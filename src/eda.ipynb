    "# Books Recommender for Children using GoodReads data\n",
    "August 9th 2025 \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a clean, analysis-ready dataset for further modeling or recommendation tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Raw Data:** Multiple JSON files in `data/all/`, each line is an individual JSON record.\n",
    "- **DataFrames:**\n",
    "  - `books_df`: Book metadata (ISBN, book_id, title, average_rating, description, etc.)\n",
    "  - `reviews_df`: User reviews (user_id, book_id, review_id, rating, review_text, n_votes)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading:** All JSON files are read into pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "2. **Book Data Preparation:** Selected columns from the books DataFrame are cleaned and formatted, including handling missing publication years.\n",
    "3. **Review Aggregation:**\n",
    "   - Count total reviews per book.\n",
    "   - Filter reviews to only those with `n_votes > 0`.\n",
    "   - For each book, select the top 20 reviews by number of votes.\n",
    "   - Aggregate these reviews: concatenate review texts and sum votes.\n",
    "   - Merge review aggregates with review counts.\n",
    "4. **Final Dataset Creation:** Merge the processed reviews with selected book metadata.\n",
    "5. **Exploratory Analysis:** \n",
    "   - Check for missing values.\n",
    "   - Display summary statistics for numeric columns.\n",
    "   - Visualize distributions of key numeric features.\n",
    "6. **Output:** Save the final merged DataFrame as a CSV file in `data/clean/books_with_reviews.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **books_with_reviews.csv:** A cleaned, aggregated dataset containing book metadata, review counts, concatenated top reviews, and total votes for those reviews.\n",

       "        \"Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.\\n--scholastic.com\",\n",

I am so happy I listened to this one- Stephen Fry was just perfect. Perfect!..and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was just the thing to put me in the Christmas Spirit. \\n It's Harry's least favorite time of year- school break spent with the Dursleys...and this visit isn't going well. First: News that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban- Second: An unfortunate accident involving mean Aunt Marge... \\n Harry decides not to stick around- and catches the Knight Bus to Diagon Alley- where instead of getting in trouble for using magic away from Hogwarts, he gets invited to stay until school begins, by Cornelius Fudge-the Minister for Magic. \\n The night before he is expected to leave- Harry is warned that Sirius may have escaped with murder in mind- and HE may be the target.... \\n This is my favorite of the series so far!! I loved that it was still light and fun...but that the darkness is slooooooooowly creeping in. \\n I loved that a lot of it took place during the Christmas Holidays... \\n I really liked the addition of the Dementors...spoooooky... \\n ...and I adored Buckbeak!! \\n As for the whereabouts of Stepheny?

I recall reading this for the first time nearly two decades ago when it came out and losing enthusiasm for the Harry Potter universe. However, I read it again so that I can read the rest with my son (he refused to read 2 and 3 with me because he felt they were the weakest books in the series and I have to say I agree with him). Nonetheless, one must read this story for the long game if one wishes to make sense of the rest.

       "575789  Buddy-read with two of my Great Escape gal pals- Stepheny and Ivonne. \\n Be on the look out for Stepheny Potthead aka The Book Pusher aka Quick Draw Stepheny aka The Nutty Professor. Last seen running along side the Knight Bus with Harry Potter's invisible cloak. Also Suspected in the kidnapping of fellow Goodreader Jeff and best-selling author Stephen King. Blonde Hair...big green doll eyes, has a frightening maniacal cackle and a tendency to whine when she doesn't get her way. LOUDLY. Considered armed and dangerous- approach with caution...and Nerds- she likes Nerds. \\n Now back to our regularly scheduled review.... \\n I don't listen to a lot of audio-books (I prefer to read) but I was kind of falling behind in my reading commitments...and I had put Ms. Stepheny off again and again for this buddy-read soooooo many times- I couldn't do it again to her (she pouts..and she gets all mopey and it is JUST heartbreaking). I am so happy I listened to this one- Stephen Fry was just perfect. Perfect!..and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was just the thing to put me in the Christmas Spirit. \\n It's Harry's least favorite time of year- school break spent with the Dursleys...and this visit isn't going well. First: News that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban- Second: An unfortunate accident involving mean Aunt Marge... \\n Harry decides not to stick around- and catches the Knight Bus to Diagon Alley- where instead of getting in trouble for using magic away from Hogwarts, he gets invited to stay until school begins, by Cornelius Fudge-the Minister for Magic. \\n The night before he is expected to leave- Harry is warned that Sirius may have escaped with murder in mind- and HE may be the target.... \\n This is my favorite of the series so far!! I loved that it was still light and fun...but that the darkness is slooooooooowly creeping in. \\n I loved that a lot of it took place during the Christmas Holidays... \\n I really liked the addition of the Dementors...spoooooky... \\n ...and I adored Buckbeak!! \\n As for the whereabouts of Stepheny? I can almost guarantee...she is up to no good.   \n",

Hey don't look at me accusing loathsome eyes, I'm not a racist just Slytherin. I'm supposed to say mean things like that.<< Gotta keep the stereotype and all. \\n So lets talk about HOW your unassuming life will change if you read this magical series; \\n De-friending not so innocent bystanders announcing \"Harry Potter is dumb\" or \"Harry Potter is for kids\" will become a common occurrence. Ask any potterhead, it happens a lot of times. \\n What is your Hogwarts house will become your idea of small talk. \\n You'll start saying Harry Potter cliches like\"I'm still waiting for my Hogwart's letter\", (probably) make random curse references (accio remote) and maybe start saying things like she is such a fake Harry Potter fan when someone doesn't know that Owlpost is the first chapter of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. \\n Umm you'll make a lot of new friends starting this way. \\n or maybe kicked out of class for calling a teacher Muggle who will unfortunately understand the reference, get offended and ban you from his class. I bet he was a Gryfinndor. \\n You''ll probably have a shrine of a lot of Harry Potter goodies. \\n Then try to convert the remaining unassuming people into Harry Potter fans. \\n Or become obsessive and say Harry Potter 50 times a day and get a award for reiteration.*thank you all* \\n P.S RIP Alan Rickman. We'll always remember your always and oily hair. \\n P.P.S OOO and even if you hate Malfoy in the books you'll have a---Lets call it a crush,for want of a better word. ON HIM. (Really) \\n And I'm not kidding with the next spoiler. It's anything but fake.   \n",

I thought that Lupin was an interesting character, but less spectacular than the previous two teachers against the Black Arts. I recall reading this for the first time nearly two decades ago when it came out and losing enthusiasm for the Harry Potter universe. However, I read it again so that I can read the rest with my son (he refused to read 2 and 3 with me because he felt they were the weakest books in the series and I have to say I agree with him). Nonetheless, one must read this story for the long game if one wishes to make sense of the rest. I am still a bit baffled by the whole switcheroo that Prang & Co did leading to the death of HP's father and mother, but perhaps they will return to that later. \\n On to The Goblet of Fire and the Quidditch World Cup!   \n",

Couldn't even take notes. Watched the movie immediately after finishing. Need next book. Wish I lived in this world. Damn you, Rowling. || Buddy-read with two of my Great Escape gal pals- Stepheny and Ivonne. \\n Be on the look out for Stepheny Potthead aka The Book Pusher aka Quick Draw Stepheny aka The Nutty Professor. Last seen running along side the Knight Bus with Harry Potter's invisible cloak. Also Suspected in the kidnapping of fellow Goodreader Jeff and best-selling author Stephen King. Blonde Hair...big green doll eyes, has a frightening maniacal cackle and a tendency to whine when she doesn't get her way. LOUDLY. Considered armed and dangerous- approach with caution...and Nerds- she likes Nerds. \\n Now back to our regularly scheduled review.... \\n I don't listen to a lot of audio-books (I prefer to read) but I was kind of falling behind in my reading commitments...and I had put Ms. Stepheny off again and again for this buddy-read soooooo many times- I couldn't do it again to her (she pouts..and she gets all mopey and it is JUST heartbreaking). I am so happy I listened to this one- Stephen Fry was just perfect. Perfect!..and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was just the thing to put me in the Christmas Spirit. \\n It's Harry's least favorite time of year- school break spent with the Dursleys...and this visit isn't going well. First: News that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban- Second: An unfortunate accident involving mean Aunt Marge... \\n Harry decides not to stick around- and catches the Knight Bus to Diagon Alley- where instead of getting in trouble for using magic away from Hogwarts, he gets invited to stay until school begins, by Cornelius Fudge-the Minister for Magic. \\n The night before he is expected to leave- Harry is warned that Sirius may have escaped with murder in mind- and HE may be the target.... \\n This is my favorite of the series so far!! I loved that it was still light and fun...but that the darkness is slooooooooowly creeping in. \\n I loved that a lot of it took place during the Christmas Holidays... \\n I really liked the addition of the Dementors...spoooooky... \\n ...and I adored Buckbeak!! \\n As for the whereabouts of Stepheny? I can almost guarantee...she is up to no good. || Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home. \\n *I was feeling guilty okay?Seeing this in my currently reading shelf while in reality it was in standby mode. * \\n And there are Moony,Padfoot,Prongs and Wormtail (Sexy names) in Prisoner of Azkaban....So, the welcome home thing gets even better. \\n --Since my reading slump won't let me read or sleep ,I might as well try to knock some sense into mudblood people who still haven't picked up the perfection that is Harry Potter. Hey don't look at me accusing loathsome eyes, I'm not a racist just Slytherin. I'm supposed to say mean things like that.&lt;&lt; Gotta keep the stereotype and all. \\n So lets talk about HOW your unassuming life will change if you read this magical series; \\n De-friending not so innocent bystanders announcing \"Harry Potter is dumb\" or \"Harry Potter is for kids\" will become a common occurrence. Ask any potterhead, it happens a lot of times. \\n What is your Hogwarts house will become your idea of small talk. \\n You'll start saying Harry Potter cliches like\"I'm still waiting for my Hogwart's letter\", (probably) make random curse references (accio remote) and maybe start saying things like she is such a fake Harry Potter fan when someone doesn't know that Owlpost is the first chapter of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. \\n Umm you'll make a lot of new friends starting this way. \\n or maybe kicked out of class for calling a teacher Muggle who will unfortunately understand the reference, get offended and ban you from his class. I bet he was a Gryfinndor. \\n You''ll probably have a shrine of a lot of Harry Potter goodies. \\n Then try to convert the remaining unassuming people into Harry Potter fans. \\n Or become obsessive and say Harry Potter 50 times a day and get a award for reiteration.*thank you all* \\n P.S RIP Alan Rickman. We'll always remember your always and oily hair. \\n P.P.S OOO and even if you hate Malfoy in the books you'll have a---Lets call it a crush,for want of a better word. ON HIM. (Really) \\n And I'm not kidding with the next spoiler. It's anything but fake. || The third HP adventure serves to bring the likable Sirius Black into the story and get Gryffindor their Quidditch Cup, but the story and action was still far less gripping than the first novel. I thought that Lupin was an interesting character, but less spectacular than the previous two teachers against the Black Arts. I recall reading this for the first time nearly two decades ago when it came out and losing enthusiasm for the Harry Potter universe. However, I read it again so that I can read the rest with my son (he refused to read 2 and 3 with me because he felt they were the weakest books in the series and I have to say I agree with him). Nonetheless, one must read this story for the long game if one wishes to make sense of the rest. I am still a bit baffled by the whole switcheroo that Prang &amp; Co did leading to the death of HP's father and mother, but perhaps they will return to that later. \\n On to The Goblet of Fire and the Quidditch World Cup! ||  || \"OMG -- Not another book review on Harry Potter.\" *or* \"OMG -- I LOVE HARRY POTTER\" \\n I bet you just said something along those lines... Me too. But I have to do this for two reasons: (1) It's Harry Potter and (2) I committed to writing a real review for every book I've read and I'm only on 202 of 454. Slap me please. But when I'm done, not quite yet. \\n However, to save us both... I won't do a review on this whole book. You can read every other review for that! I'll just say the top 5 reasons why I loved this particular book: \\n 1. Harry Potter went dark! Not the book... the character... this was the first time for me where I really stood back and said \"He's growing up. He's realizing not everything around him should be believed without a hint of doubt.\" When he protected Sirius in the Shrieking Shack, it all changed for me. \\n 2. Dementors are awesome. I love the concept of stealing someone's soul through sucking their physical body off its bones. \\n 3. Transfiguration is a focus point, and I love seeing people turn into animals. It's like our core is bursting to show itself. \\n 4. Remus was my favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He was someone I'd want to hang out with... you know, and be a werewolf and all. \\n 5. History is revealed in many family connections and secrets. And since that's my favorite thing... this book was the most eye-opening for me. \\n See, that wasn't so bad to re-read a little bit of Harry Potter. I promise the next one won't be so hard. Only 4 left to write a review for. \\n About Me \\n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find TV &amp; Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world. And you can find all my social media profiles to get the details on the who/what/when/where and my pictures. Leave a comment and let me know what you think. Vote in the poll and ratings. Thanks for stopping by. \\n [polldaddy poll=9729544] \\n [polldaddy poll=9719251] || I read this as a buddy read, but really I wanted to compare the text to the movies more than anything. I've watched them so much and I've only read the series once through. (Now twice through this third book.) \\n So what do I think about this monstrosity of a series that gets so many hearts a-pumpin? About this book in particular? \\n I love it. \\n But how about this book in comparison to the film, you ask? \\n ALAS! I like the movie better. \\n What??? Blasphemy! Heretic! \\n No no no, give me a chance. I liked the fact that Hermione develops real stressed-out reasons for giving up the time-turner even if the reasons are still rather weak, all told, when taken in conjunction with all the other crap that happens in the series later. It'll always be one of those hedge-moments for me. BUT, putting that aside, the actual narrative events that happen in the book that I think are the best parts, namely the space of a certain 3 hour stretch, BOTH times, was much more fascinating and fleshed out in the movie. \\n Sorry! It's true! All the expressions and the little tidbits and quirks were more brilliant on the screen. And so was the penultimate event that always... ALWAYS brings tears to my eyes... the moment when Harry realizes that he was the one to bring out that awesome power to save himself. Even now I tear up when I think about it. \\n Yes, the book has it, but the build up was just too quick in the text. The movie, however, did what movies are brilliant at.... SHOWING us the enormity of the event. Sometimes it just takes the right media. \\n The movie is my favorite of the series. I'm reserving judgement as to whether the book is as well. (At least until I finish my re-read. :) || Is there any way to write a review on any of the Harry Potter books without doing it injustice? Nearly nobody attempts to create a full review on this series because of 1) its popularity, 2) its huge fanbase and 3) its awesomeness in general. And neither will I do so. The first book was fantastic, although I read it probably ten years too late in my life. The second book was not so fantastic, but still a great book. And the third one ... completely blew my mind. \\n I wanted to write a review on this book; I even started a checklist to keep track of what I wanted to add here. But the further I delved into the stories about the Prisoner of Azkaban, the more did I realize that the only things I was going to say were 'X is awesome', 'Y rocks' and 'Z simply has to be the winner'. The only aspect which might be criticized about this book might be the fact that some characters like Voldemort, Malfoy or, on the other hand, Harry, Hermione or Ron are relatively black or white, evil or good. But I don't mind. Because. Those. Characters. Are. Amazing. Hagrid and Lupin are my new favorites after reading this book. And I want more of Hedwig, because - owls! \\n In contrast to the two previous books, the pace is so wonderfully matching in this book. Just at the right time before the descriptions of the Hogwarts school year (all of them contributing to the entire plot) might turn too extensive, the story climbs up to its climax and concludes within one hundred pages of incredible tension. Logical relevations, long-desired confrontations and a lot of surprises will accompany you during your journey with Harry and his friends, resulting in the convergence of several different plotlines which were established during the course of the novel. \\n Most of the people I know have read this book, but if you happen to be one of the few exceptions, then go read it. Maybe you fear it because of its fantasy elements? I've never been a fan of fantasy either, but this book series changed my opinion. Maybe you fear it because of its popularity? Don't be afraid. The hype is completely justified. \\n My reviews in the Harry Potter series: \\n 1) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: Go to review \\n 2) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: Go to review || Shit got real! \\n For me, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was when the series got exciting! It certainly got darker and more mature. Torture, loss, a foreboding sense of dread and death itself descended upon this happy little world of magic where school exams and difficult professors were the worst things to worry about until recently. \\n I'm a big fan of the tone. The series jumps right into its bigboy pants here. As an adult reading these books, I was glad to see the maturity. Yeah, it's still YA and not targeted towards me, but at least now it felt a little closer to something in my old man range. \\n As mentioned before, there's an ever present element of death in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Those ghoulish dementors are death itself. However, it also introduced a reason for Harry to want to live: his godfather, a connection to his parents. Up until then there was little joy in Harry's life. Sure there was the school, but that would end soon enough. Rowling did a smart thing when she introduced Sirius Black, she gave Harry a human bond and something to lose. As readers our attachment grew with his. That was when Harry became real to me. || Re-read 2015 - 5 always magical stars \\n Let's not talk about how Sirius kept his sanity (most of it anyway) in Azkaban to avenge his best friends. \\n Or how he asked Harry to stay with him for the summer \\n And the thing that happened in the later books... \\n Let's not... || 5 STARS!!! \\n My Favorite book and movie in the HP series!! I loved diving back into this world and reading about Sirius and Remus again and how dark this one was.

Next month I will do my best to read Goblet of Fire, it's a chunker so I hope it works out. haha - Richard || Hey, Jo? || Perfection again. Re-reading this series is making me SO happy.

None of us have read or finished the Harry Potter series, and as teachers it is about time we read one of the most popular YA book series. \\n This book starts off like the other two Harry Potter books. Harry is at his Aunt and Uncle's place and gets rescued from their evil ways and makes his way to the wizarding world. This book has a similar pattern to the other books. Harry is involved in Quidditch and in every game he faces challenges from the outside. He also has a villain in this book that is not Lord V. Black is a murderer escaped from Azkaban and is being pursued by the soul-sucking Dementors who guarded him in prison. \\n Harry faces multiple challenges and problems and overcomes them with greatness. These books are decently predictable, but J.K. Rowling's fantastic writing makes up for it. || I just really really love Remus Lupin okay || I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. \\n These book really never get old. No matter how many times I read them (and I read them a lot). I love the time turner part of the book and watching them watch themselves going through everything. Love love love Sirius and Remus and this is when the overall story really starts to get going! || 4.5 \\n My favorite Harry Potter so far. The cast of characters and world really expanded in this one and there were some moments of brilliance. My one complaint was the pacing, as something great would happen and then there'd be long stretches of time without much plot development. I still don't feel like I'm aboard the HP fandom train but I think I might be getting there. Also psyched I finally know what the Marauders Map is. || Yep, still my favourite.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. \\n Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. \\n Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. \\n Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor. || Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. AlisonaEUR(tm)s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldnaEUR(tm)t put it down. Obviously, as the classaEUR(tm)s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. \\n Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. \\n This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If weaEUR(tm)re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they donaEUR(tm)t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesnaEUR(tm)t apply to them, and in some ways thataEUR(tm)s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. \\n And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesnaEUR(tm)t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonistaEUR(tm)s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. \\n As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. IaEUR(tm)ve read it six more times since then, and itaEUR(tm)s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If youaEUR(tm)re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If youaEUR(tm)re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest. \\n For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings. || I.love.this.book. \\n Seriously, I read this maybe in fourth grade? It was definitly in elementary school, because I remember it was at the same time that we we doing \"survival skills\"* in Girl Scouts. Not that I ever wanted to be trapped by myself in the wilderness, but I spent a lot of my time in my backyard pretending to find flint with my sister, and starting imaginary fires to keep warm. In winter we dug ourselves igloos. I always went camping with my parents, so this book started a lot of Q&amp;A's with them about what to do if I get lost in the woods (Hint, No. 1 is STAY WHERE YOU ARE!). Any ways, its a great read for an elementary kid, and everyone should read it. \\n * This was put in quotation marks because it was a total joke. I had been looking forward to these skills for quite some time, finally girl scouts was going to teach me what I wanted! Instead of knives they handed us popsicle sticks. For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire. Basically we made banana boats, and then the instructor put the boats in and out of the coals for us. We learned how to build a fire with coals, not tinder. Agh. It was at this point that I decided Girl Scouts was NOT for me. || Gary Paulsen writes in only two emotions: fine and vomit-y. Someone may want to tell him that there are other ways to provoke a response in a reader than going right for the gut, so to speak. This book could have done with some fear and suspense, perhaps some gratification, depression, or joy. I do not mind a tragedy, nor do I balk at watching the man beaten down. I am a fan of Chekhov's. \\n If your idea of suspense is mosquito bites on your nipples, meet your Stephen King. || ok I read this like 8 years ago but I remember it pretty well? it's not bad but survival books aren't my thing so this was kinda boring || A story of a boy that survives a small plane crash into the wilderness. The pilot (and only other person on the plane) had a heart attack and died. Every struggle and triumph are fascinating. A must read for young readers. One of the books I will never forget. || I can see why kids would love it, but the tale of survival didn't entirely grab me. || So when I added this, I vaguely recalled the title, and I swear, I have definitely read it, but what I thought it was about was a boy being stuck under the snow following an avalanche (it turns out the book I was thinking of is apty named Avalanche by Arthur Roth) but anyway, that's not what it is about, and I really don't remember this book at all. \\n Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet: \\n 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. \\n 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? \\n 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. \\n 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies) \\n 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). \\n 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? \\n Get it! So good! || This was a book that my 9 year old and I read together and I have to tell you, he was riveted. It's a classic by now (first published in the 80s) and for good reason...it keeps the reader on the edge of their seat for the entire book. \\n If you're not familiar, here's the premise: child of divorcing parents is sent from his New York City home during summer vacation up to visit his father on a work site in the northern Canadian wilderness via a small, single-engine airplane. Enroute, the pilot suffers a heart attack and dies. The plane crashes in the wilderness, off-course. Child survives but no rescue crew can find him. The only tools he has are a hatchet and his wits. He must learn to survive. \\n Wow. Talk about riveting. My son spent the entire book trying to anticipate what was going to happen, whether the survival techniques he was using in the book were smart or not, whether they'd work, how it could be done better, etc and so on. In other words, it made him think. \\n As for the veracity of the book, Paulsen did his homework. The airplane scene, which stretches on for some time, is spot on. As a pilot, I'm always dismayed by authors who try to write about flying scenes and don't even take the time to ask a real pilot (such as easy, quick question that all pilots would be happy to answer to make the scene realistic) basic questions...it frequently makes me toss a book aside. Either Paulsen flies himself or thought to ask and the result is a realistic crash scene. Bravo! He also describes in an afterward to the book all the research he did on the survival techniques his character uses in the book...he tested each one himself, even the foods his character eats (eeeewww, trust me, eeeeeww). Perhaps this is why the book is so loved all these years later....it's realistic. Kids love it. I loved it. \\n Age range for reading? I'm thinking 3rd grade and up. I've seen it read in classrooms starting around 3rd grade and that is the age where my son could really grasp the implications of what was going on. Also, due to the divorce issues also going on (Mom has a 'boyfriend' which is why the marriage is breaking up), it would probably be difficult for a younger child to understand what is going on there. \\n Highly recommended. || This a great survival story that really holds the interest of young boys. The writing itself wasn't extremely well done, but the plot made up for it decently enough. \\n Interest Level Grades 5 - 8 \\n Grade Level Equivalent 5.7 \\n http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/bo... || Still fantastic after all these years || If I could rate it 0 stars, I would. The only reason I read this is for school. Trust me, I wouldn't have if Mrs. Jones (not her real name), my fifth grade teacher hadn't made me. It's just so repetitive. Every chapter, excluding the first few and the last, are the same thing: he wakes up, looks for food, runs into some animal, get's hurt and then this \"secret\" thing that they keep bringing up? Seriously, just mention it once and move on, Paulsen. Anyway, I hated this book. Luckily, I'll never have to read the sequel... (Que forshaddow-y music) || I read this with my son and year or two ago. I know that I read it once as a kid myself but it was so long ago I was really fuzzy on the details. So here's my sons (10 y/o ish) thoughts on the book: \\n I really dig the survival aspect of books, especially how it was presented this book. My heart was pounding, waiting to see if he survived. I didn't know how it was going to end so it kept me anxious and excited. I really think he should have stopped eating those berries though. Gross. Overall it was a fantastic read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. || As many of you might know, I abhor the YA designation, believing it to be a form of segregation that simply makes it a target for the Comstockians of the world, witness recent calls for YA books to be more wholesome and less dark. That many so-called YA titles deal with issues that should be of concern to teens seems of little concern to those who want to prevent their sixteen-year-olds from reading about what they experience everyday. The YA designation, I suspect, has, in the past, steered many adult readers away from books so designated, not wanting to be seen as stooping below their level. (I use young adult and adult only in their chronological sense, certainly not from the standpoint of maturity level.) \\n Our reading club decided to discuss a couple of books that had been enjoyed by some of our members from that standpoint. We chose two: Hatchet and Waiting to Forget (review to follow), each in its own way a survival novel, both in a wilderness, but one made of trees, the other of people. \\n The differences are substantial with Waiting to Forget much more adult both in content and style. Hatchet is a great story for 10 year-olds (and young 60 year-olds) about a young boy (age thirteen) being sent to his father in Canada following a nasty divorce. The pilot of the single engined plane dies of a heart attack, and young Brian must find a way to stay alive in the wilderness (a remarkably non-hostile environment with the exception of a moose and tornado) with only a hatchet fortuitously given to him by his mother for survival. The book is told in third-person from Brian's perspective so it's hardly a spoiler to say young Brian, a very smart kid, indeed, survives by using his wits and, fortuitously, the hatchet given to him by his mother as a present before he left to visit his father. \\n It's a good survival story although some of the elements like \"the Secret\" were peripheral and distracted from the story line. The Epilogue was totally unnecessary and redundant, I thought. The last line before it would have made a perfect ending. My understanding is that Paulson followed up with the success of Hatchet with a couple of sequels. \\n As I read this enjoyable little book, I wondered if Paulson had become enamored of Tom Brown who achieved some fame as being a great \"tracker\" and wilderness expert. Raised in the Jersey Pine Barrens, he was ostensibly the grandson of an Apache named \"Stalking Wolf.\"(I'm not kidding.) Brown wrote several pieces on wilderness survival for Mother Jones in the eighties. I remember several nature types on the faculty asking me to order his books many years ago, although the luster seemed to tarnish some when it was learned Brown was fond of smoking. \\n Looking up Tom Brown for this review I discovered he has capitalized on his knowledge. http://www.trackertrail.com/tombrown/... \\n Tom Brown books: Tom Brown's Field guide to wilderness survival and Tracker and Tom Brown's Field Guide To Living With The Earth || For the last few months, I have been going into my son's classroom and reading with a small group for an hour. This is exactly my kind of volunteering. We each take turns reading aloud and when the hour is up, we mark our place for the next week. \\n Our group, which contained five boys and myself, read The Hatchet, a book about 13 year-old Brian Robeson, who survives in the Canadian wilderness for months after the airplane he was traveling in to visit his father crashes - in large part because he has in his possession a hatchet given to him by his mother. \\n I was very impressed with those 8 and 9 year-old attention spans because, after the initial crash, which is quite exciting, the book moves at a snails pace. There are lots and lots of details about Brian building a shelter and the process in which he finds food (from berries, eggs, fish to finally game meat) and Brian's own inner dialogue about what his fate will be. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the author, Gary Paulsen, uses a technique of repeating emphasis words regularly throughout paragraphs that the boys were able to pick up as a unique to that author writing style. It was so fun to discuss those kinds of things with these bright boys. Paulsen also included plenty of vomiting, diarrhea, animal attacks and other bits of danger to completely hook his young readers. \\n I admit to being a tad worried about the theme of divorce and The Secret (which turned out to be that Brian saw his mother kissing another man in a car), but was relieved to discover that it wasn't the emphasis of the book and even my sheltered and innocent son seemed able to handle these mature ideas. \\n I'm not as sure girls of the same age would like it, but The Hatchet was a hit with my 8 year old. Plus, mom liked it too. || What an outstanding read. I have read it at least 3 x. || This is one of those books that all kids apparently read in school at a certain age. It wasn't written till the late 80s, so I was at that certain age too early. \\n This is a survival story. Brian is a passenger in a prop plane that crashes in the (I guess) Canadian wilderness. He's the only survivor, and has to learn everything he needs to make it in the wild on his own. \\n Other readers have complained that Brian as a character is pretty bland, that he's not very well fleshed out. But the book is not about Brian; it's about the ability of someone (in this case, a thirteen-year-old city boy) to survive with next to no resources and almost no skills. \\n I really enjoyed this book, as an adventure story for young readers. I had a couple quibbles - mostly Paulsen's habit of repeating phrases; he repeats phrases; repeats them - but overall, this was a good, fairly quick read. I'm curious to know what the rest of the books in the series will add to the story. || Review to come || A nostalgic read for me, as I really loved this book when I was younger and wanted to reread it. I think this is where my love of survival stories came from! I had a bit of fun rereading this, even if some parts dragged a bit on the reread. I will always have fond memories of this book! || One of those books that I was tired of people referencing. When I talked to my students, almost all the boys said Gary Paulsen was their favorite author, so I had to go back and read some of his stuff myself. I never had. I guess when I was the right age to read it, I was off with Tamora Pierce. \\n What's the fuss? It's incredibly simplistic in style and plot, but maybe that's just because I'm twice as old as the intended age range. I read it in about an hour. Survivalist, hunting types would enjoy this, but I think I'd prefer to push kids into something that made them think a bit harder. Not that this is brain junk by any means, but I'd think of it more as a bridge to better literature. Kids would get excited about this, love this, and then you can eventually switch it out for something a bit more involved.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Just stumbled upon this book by accident, thank you, Goodreads! Have been trying to remember the title for the longest time! I read this several times in grade school, it fascinated me! Ivy Carson is from a, well, trashy family, but she herself is very different. She tells the mousy Martha who is her best friend that she is the daughter of the fairy queen, and has been switched with the real Ivy Carson. Ivy is a gifted but unschooled dancer, with wild black hair and capricious moods. She reminded me, in a way, of my own best friend in junior high. There is something timeless and beautiful about this book, and how Ivy and Martha change over the years. I just adored this little book, and I should find a copy for my daughter, when she's a bit older. || This is the book that first introduced me to Zilpha Keatley Snyder, who was my absolute favorite author as a kid. This book is not a fantasy, but it did inspire a fantasy series, the excellent Green Sky trilogy. Marty \"the mouse\" becomes friends with Ivy Carson, an unusual girl from a large and notorious family, who claims to be a changeling. I really can't do the book justice, but I think anyone who's felt like an outcast, or had a life-changing friendship (or wanted one) will love this book. || ** spoiler alert ** \\n I don't remember when I first read this book. I think I got it from the Scholastic Book Company when I was in second grade (1971 or 1972); we lived in a very rural area in northern New Mexico and my mother basically allowed me to order every book I wanted when the Scholastic catalog came. I know I then read it many, many times over the years that followed... and then, of course, at some point it got packed away with the rest of my \"kid's books\" and I haven't touched it in ages. \\n But now, as it goes, I'm \"old enough for fairy tales again\" (not that I really ever stopped - I'm not a Gryffindor for nothing), and I found it again when I was recommended other books by Keatley-Snyder. While looking those up, I found \"The Changeling\" again. \\n I knew this book had been very formative for my young mind, I just had forgotten quite how MUCH. I was Martha -- chubby, frightened of everything, burst into tears at the slightest thing; the main difference was I was the oldest child in the family, and, of course, I never had an Ivy. \\n I wanted to be like Martha when I was young, because I was sure I would grow up like she did, tall and slim and loved by everyone... but I never made it THERE. I stayed chubby, but I did end up in all the plays in high school, as a character actor. I made up stories, I wrote them down, I dreamed and wished and never wanted to grow up (and really, that spell DOES work)... I never got thin, but I eventually met my own \"Ivy.\" I didn't meet her early enough to dream with me on that childhood level, but we plan on growing old together, if possibly never grown UP together (because she loved the book, too). \\n I know I don't say a whole lot about the actual book here, but my review is based on feelings and impressions rather than the events in the story. Needless to say, it still holds up just as beautifully as it did then -- sure, now it only took me about two hours to read instead of weeks... but I still lost myself just as deeply within the beautiful lines that Keatley-Snyder wove here. I only wish I could be as brilliant a storyteller (not to say I don't TRY). \\n I still love this book - I love the story, the characters, my feelings and impressions when I read it and how it makes me feel afterward. Beautiful, dreamy, mystic, alien, lost, found, sure of myself, unsure, scared, exhilarated, joyous... everything. Everything. I think this book may have been everything to my growing up. I've never lost it. \\n Know all the questions, but never the answers. || read this just out of my teens, and loved it to pieces. My paperback is falling apart, alas, so I have not reread it for some twenty years. So I don't know how it holds up to my adult view, but the friendship, the approach to being different and creativity were impressive to me when young.</td>\n",

Since I had further elaborated when pressed, that we were going by boat - another fixation I had throughout childhood, seafaring - and the term holiday was a mere fortnight, news soon spread through the school that my mother was leaving her teaching job. In case you don't get the plot so far, I was weaving this fantasy in Australia where I was born and raised. \\n Never mind the trouble I got into for this, it didn't in the least affect my taste for anything Swittish. \\n Since then, as an adult I've been able to visit Switzerland five times, mostly Geneva. By no means goatherd territory, but still. You can see Geneva as a straightforwardly beautiful city. You can see it through Australian eyes as having that aesthetic qualities of age that our cities so lack, not to mention the mountain backdrop the like of which we would never see at home. Or you can see it, I discover, as a young child would whose dreams were always of other places. I confess as I've wandered about the city, staring at those snow-capped mountains, to feeling that I have come home in some way that I'm sure derives from the profound effect this utterly magical book had on me when I read it so long ago. \\n I don't know if other people wonder if they have let down the small bundles of hopes and dreams they once were, but I do. It breaks my heart, the idea that I might have disappointed that little hopeful dreaming thing I was once, and I have found it a very emotional experience being in this dream I once went to sleep with every night. I really can't remember, but I hope she - I - did always believe dreams come true. Yeah, well. Sometimes they do. || A heartwarming classic children's book that is meaningful for adults... \\n I loved Heidi as a child. This book was a dog-eared favorite! I did enjoy revisiting this book recently as part of a group read, as an adult. However, I do think that the magic of the book is best for children. I will fully disclose that 1 of the stars is completely nostalgic! \\n What I loved: \\n * The beautiful descriptions of the setting -- the Alps in Switzerland \\n * The fact that Heidi had such a positive impact on those around her -- the \"Alm-Uncle\" (her grandfather), Peter's grandma, Clara, Peter (she taught him to read), the doctor \\n * Feeling uplifted after reading the story \\n * The hope, positive attitude, and altruism of Heidi -- always looking to make a difference and help people \\n What I didn't care for as much: \\n * The one-dimensionality of some of the characters -- i.e., Aunt Dete \\n * The quickness and the magnitude of the change in some characters (for the better) was hard to believe -- i.e., the Alm Uncle \\n * The innumerable references to God \\n * Heidi -- never acted like a child and was too angelic to be believable \\n I love to imagine the pure beauty of Heidi's life in the Alps with her grandfather. \\n I recommend this book to all children!! Also, to readers of Classics or Children's Literature in general. Wikipedia touts Heidi as being one of the bestselling books ever written and one of the best known works of Swiss literature. || THE SUNDAY FAMILY READ \\n Heidi was one of my most read books as a child. I think our family owned it so I could just pick it up and read it whenever I wanted to. I remember being entranced by the fact that Heidi's aunt made her wear ALL her clothes so there would be nothing to carry on the journey to Grandfather. It was a hot spring day when Heidi made that first climb up the mountain to her grandfather's cabin. I felt sorry for her being so over-dressed but I knew right away that the aunt was a \"bad person.\" \\n As soon as they got to Grandfather, even though he was thought of as a \"bad person,\" I could tell he was good. It only made the aunt more bad for leaving her niece with someone considered to be dangerous. \\n There you have the wonder of Johanna Spyri's writing. She didn't come right out and say who was bad, good, or otherwise but showed these qualities by her storytelling. Her heavy religious message did not bother me as a child because it fit right in with what I had been taught. It didn't bother me during this rereading either, even when Clara's grandmother was clearly preaching Christian theology, because it is done with so much love and understanding while doing no one any harm. \\n I did notice that the first half of the book is more interesting and exciting while the second half has more lessons, as it were, and gets a bit serious. It turns out that Ms Spyri wrote two books: Heidi's Years of Learning and Travel, then Heidi Make Use of What She Has Learned, later combined into one. Those titles hint at the shift in emphasis. I did always like the first half the most, but remember being so happy when everything turned out well for Heidi, Peter, Clara and all the grandparents. \\n In any case, I loved it just as much as ever, I cried a few times, and was overjoyed to spend time with someone whom I once considered a friend. || Heidi is definitely a classic; most people I know have read it as a child themselves and it's a story of a girl who tries to make the best out of a bad situation, creating a very interesting little adventure. || I'd set out with just my e-reader and a camera to find some outdoor cafe in the remote mountains of the Balkans. After finding the only apparent cafe in the village, on the other side of several cow pastures, I decided to just keep going to the waterfall, no matter how long it took. It took a long time. Clouds gathered, the path directives had lost their arrowheads, and the few stragglers coming back looked weary of the effort. \\n It started to rain, really hard. I crossed the rocks of the muddy stream bed and headed uphill towards the falls anyway. It was raining and thundering too hard to feel safe. Through purest luck, I saw a rock overhang and dry rock for sitting just off the trail. Sopping wet, I considered the vagaries of mountain rain clouds (\"if you don't like the weather, wait 10 minutes\") and wondered if there were too many drips falling from the rocks to read an ereader under it, eventually. I did. Having been really frightened by the narrow switchback roads hugging the cliffs coming up by car that morning, despite the high, stark beauty, I'd then seen my first mountain men in their element, taciturn lords of glorified cabins. I needed a reminder of why a trip to remote mountains was worth it, and maybe Heidi was the book I needed. By that time I'd met someone like the angry grandfather and the goats on mountain passes. I was so transported, I didn't realize the rain had stopped until other refuges from above started hiking back down to the village, stopping to stare at me. Per usual, the characters in the book took my fancy, but the scenery was no match for the rain-free reality around me soon after, though the book may have heightened my awareness at least. \\n For all the dubious claims of healthy sun and fresh air which events in Heidi contain, I myself limped back to a city 2 days later, unable to sleep or walk, despite years of walking 2-3km a day, and years prior living at much higher altitudes. I'd always been suspicious that 19th century tuberculosis cases got better in low oxygen environments, but never thought oxygen deprivation or rich yogurt would plague my legs. Finishing Heidi's adventures from a balcony in the city, I had the bizarre experience of suddenly missing the mountain setting, and so, had to put down Heidi until it made me less homesick for the high, sleepless, rainy mountain I'd just left. \\n Since then I've read a British woman's account of the same Balkan mountains, some 20 years after Heidi was written. Mountain men were indeed violent and tribal, and certainly not strictly in the Balkans. They were also clothed and fed a lot better than grandmamma in Heidi, no matter how poor they'd been. \\n It brings up the question of how Heidi and friends could get so healthy and fat eating so little. I did love the distinctive yogurt they served, but even if it took 2 hours of offroading to reach a market, it still could have been store bought. Mostly I'm reminded of an exceptionally large number of simple dishes, so many in fact that I never ate more than a single meal every day. \\n The writer of Heidi was from a small mountain village. The Swiss do in fact live quite a long time. The air must have been remarkably fresher than in Frankfurt, which must have smelled a lot more of banker than any city today. I could no longer sense the difference in mountain air, although I did begin to pick up scents on the trail, after believing that my sense of smell had been lost many years ago. \\n Here are a few questions to consider when you read Heidi: \\n What made grandfather so angry? \\n Is Peter a model for boys? Is Heidi? \\n Did Heidi sound too young for her age? \\n Did she sound unusually concerned about adults around her? \\n How did the doctor help grandmamma? \\n What kind of conversations did grandfather and the doctor have? \\n What does it say that the mountain folk are gossips and the city folk are miracle workers? || My copy of Heidi is actually a hardback with beautiful illustrations. I loved this book. Probably very unrealistic, with an overly idyllic picture of the setting -- but lovely all the same. || Cuon truyen thieu nhi nhe nhang voi cai ket nhu truyen co tich. Se nho mai Heidi, Clara, bac Alm, Peter, ba noi cua Peter va Clara, mon pho mat va sua de cua bac Alm va vung Dorfli day Alps (Heidi's Land tai Thuy Si). || Wonderful children's tale of a young girl growing up in the Swiss Alps with her grandfather. I first read this classic more than 60 years ago when I was a child. Such solid messages of Christian faith and virtue seldom seen in literature for children today. I loved this book then and I loved it now. || `l~ lrWuGm mn nh tuSnWaf fy qsm qSS l'Tfl lknny qr'th t`wyDan lnfsy l'nWy lm 't`rWf `lyh fy Tfwlty .. '`Ttny sh`wran jmylan .. s'ftqdh [?][?] || This book has sold more than fifty million copies worldwide, has been translated into over fifty languages, and has been enjoyed by generations of children. Heidi is a charming story is about an orphaned girl who is sent away from her aunt to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps. Heidi's grandfather is a cold hearted and mean man when they first meet. Slowly they get to know one another and the love between Heidi and her grandfather grows. Heidi also becomes friends with two other children, Peter and Clara. When Peter, who is Heidi's grandfather's shepherd, starts to become jealous of her relationship with wheelchair bound Clara, he sets in motion a terrible, yet ultimately wonderful event. \\n This is one of those classic books that I would highly recommend to anyone, from a ten year old to an adult. It demonstrates the power of friendship. Unlike the angst driven young characters of today, Heidi is a heartwarming girl who is always grateful and contented, no matter what her situation. Is it realistic? Probably not, but it's still a lovely story. The first time I read Heidi was 55 years ago and occasionally I like to go to my \"nostalgia\" bookshelf and recapture a moment of childhood magic. It's hard to find a more magical story than \"Heidi\". || A saccharine, yet strangely readable, children's book about a little Swiss girl who transforms the lives of nearly everyone she meets. I'd read this one as a kid but remembered too little to count it for my world books challenge without a re-read. The beauty of the mountain and Heidi's love for it are vividly depicted. Spyri doesn't talk down to her child readers, and I wouldn't have guessed this to be a translation without being told (though there are some ways of writing that passed in the 19th century but wouldn't today: \"'That would be all very well if he were like other people,' asseverated stout Barbel warmly\"). It continues to surprise me that so many favorite children's books are so old, and yet children have no trouble with them, while adult classics are more difficult and less widely read. This one is probably best enjoyed by readers of an age to readily identify with Heidi, but despite some idealization and religious messaging it was a pleasant enough read as an adult too. || A fast paced story with beautiful snapshots of alpes mountainous area. If only the story was a bit longer with more details. But considering reading it to a kid, the length is enough. \\n A story that brings tears to my eyes and Given that not all kid stories can do it, 4.5 stars. || Such a sweet story, and one that the whole family will love to read together. || This was always one of my least-favorite classics. Oh well. It's still a good book, and I like it... but not really my cup of tea. I don't get bored easily by books. This one, unfortunately, bored me largely to death. || So, it turns out, there are really good reasons why certain books become classics. This was a delightful book to study with my littles. || I thought this book was so exotic at the time. || Loved this as a kid. It's a bit cloying for current times, though. || For some reason, I decided yesterday that I needed to reread this. I know I read it and loved it as a kid, but I did not at ALL remember the heavy handed Christianity that was half the book. I must have zoomed on by it in favor of the nature descriptions. \\n So, yeah, this was totally a moral tale. And just about everyone, outside of Peter and Uncle Alp, were either nearly perfect or nearly all bad. Heidi just barely managed to not be cloying though - she could be pretty bitchy sometimes, and that helped a lot. I'd always had this little Heidi/Peter memory vibe from this story, but he was kind of a possessive, selfish jerk. \\n Between this and Anne, I guess it's no wonder that I love nature so much. But not so much that I trust it allows a girl who is paralyzed to walk again. Sigh. Still, the chapters in town are perfectly oppressive and depressing, and the mountain chapters uplifting and beautiful. It was clearly well translated, and I did enjoy the reread. || What a good story about a young girl's childhood and her relationship with her loving grandfather. || Published in 1880, it's full of Victorian sentimentality. Heidi, an innocent and artless child brings joy to poor crippled Clara. She persuades her grumpy old grandfather to start going to church again. She persuades rough-around-the-edges goatherd Peter to learn to read. She spends her money on soft white rolls for his poor blind old grandma. She revels in the glory of nature. And she gets the better of the horrible servant with the give-away name Rottenmeier who deserves to be laughed at. Absolutely loved it as a child, but not sure it's stood the test of time.</td>\n",

beginning to wonder if there will ever be a Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher who is just a teacher. || Still five stars. Love this so much. Can't review. Couldn't even take notes. Watched the movie immediately after finishing. Need next book. Wish I lived in this world. Damn you, Rowling. || Buddy-read with two of my Great Escape gal pals- Stepheny and Ivonne. \\n Be on the look out for Stepheny Potthead aka The Book Pusher aka Quick Draw Stepheny aka The Nutty Professor. Last seen running along side the Knight Bus with Harry Potter's invisible cloak. Also Suspected in the kidnapping of fellow Goodreader Jeff and best-selling author Stephen King. Blonde Hair...big green doll eyes, has a frightening maniacal cackle and a tendency to whine when she doesn't get her way. LOUDLY. Considered armed and dangerous- approach with caution...and Nerds- she likes Nerds. \\n Now back to our regularly scheduled review.... \\n I don't listen to a lot of audio-books (I prefer to read) but I was kind of falling behind in my reading commitments...and I had put Ms. Stepheny off again and again for this buddy-read soooooo many times- I couldn't do it again to her (she pouts..and she gets all mopey and it is JUST heartbreaking). I am so happy I listened to this one- Stephen Fry was just perfect. Perfect!..and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was just the thing to put me in the Christmas Spirit. \\n It's Harry's least favorite time of year- school break spent with the Dursleys...and this visit isn't going well. First: News that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban- Second: An unfortunate accident involving mean Aunt Marge... \\n Harry decides not to stick around- and catches the Knight Bus to Diagon Alley- where instead of getting in trouble for using magic away from Hogwarts, he gets invited to stay until school begins, by Cornelius Fudge-the Minister for Magic. \\n The night before he is expected to leave- Harry is warned that Sirius may have escaped with murder in mind- and HE may be the target.... \\n This is my favorite of the series so far!! I loved that it was still light and fun...but that the darkness is slooooooooowly creeping in. \\n I loved that a lot of it took place during the Christmas Holidays... \\n I really liked the addition of the Dementors...spoooooky... \\n ...and I adored Buckbeak!! \\n As for the whereabouts of Stepheny? I can almost guarantee...she is up to no good. || Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home. \\n *I was feeling guilty okay?Seeing this in my currently reading shelf while in reality it was in standby mode. * \\n And there are Moony,Padfoot,Prongs and Wormtail (Sexy names) in Prisoner of Azkaban....So, the welcome home thing gets even better. \\n --Since my reading slump won't let me read or sleep ,I might as well try to knock some sense into mudblood people who still haven't picked up the perfection that is Harry Potter. Hey don't look at me accusing loathsome eyes, I'm not a racist just Slytherin. I'm supposed to say mean things like that.<< Gotta keep the stereotype and all. \\n So lets talk about HOW your unassuming life will change if you read this magical series; \\n De-friending not so innocent bystanders announcing \"Harry Potter is dumb\" or \"Harry Potter is for kids\" will become a common occurrence. Ask any potterhead, it happens a lot of times. \\n What is your Hogwarts house will become your idea of small talk. \\n You'll start saying Harry Potter cliches like\"I'm still waiting for my Hogwart's letter\", (probably) make random curse references (accio remote) and maybe start saying things like she is such a fake Harry Potter fan when someone doesn't know that Owlpost is the first chapter of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. \\n Umm you'll make a lot of new friends starting this way. \\n or maybe kicked out of class for calling a teacher Muggle who will unfortunately understand the reference, get offended and ban you from his class. I bet he was a Gryfinndor. \\n You''ll probably have a shrine of a lot of Harry Potter goodies. \\n Then try to convert the remaining unassuming people into Harry Potter fans. \\n Or become obsessive and say Harry Potter 50 times a day and get a award for reiteration.*thank you all* \\n P.S RIP Alan Rickman. We'll always remember your always and oily hair. \\n P.P.S OOO and even if you hate Malfoy in the books you'll have a---Lets call it a crush,for want of a better word. ON HIM. (Really) \\n And I'm not kidding with the next spoiler. It's anything but fake. || The third HP adventure serves to bring the likable Sirius Black into the story and get Gryffindor their Quidditch Cup, but the story and action was still far less gripping than the first novel. I thought that Lupin was an interesting character, but less spectacular than the previous two teachers against the Black Arts. I recall reading this for the first time nearly two decades ago when it came out and losing enthusiasm for the Harry Potter universe. However, I read it again so that I can read the rest with my son (he refused to read 2 and 3 with me because he felt they were the weakest books in the series and I have to say I agree with him). Nonetheless, one must read this story for the long game if one wishes to make sense of the rest. I am still a bit baffled by the whole switcheroo that Prang & Co did leading to the death of HP's father and mother, but perhaps they will return to that later. \\n On to The Goblet of Fire and the Quidditch World Cup! ||  || \"OMG -- Not another book review on Harry Potter.\" *or* \"OMG -- I LOVE HARRY POTTER\" \\n I bet you just said something along those lines... Me too. But I have to do this for two reasons: (1) It's Harry Potter and (2) I committed to writing a real review for every book I've read and I'm only on 202 of 454. Slap me please. But when I'm done, not quite yet. \\n However, to save us both... I won't do a review on this whole book. You can read every other review for that! I'll just say the top 5 reasons why I loved this particular book: \\n 1. Harry Potter went dark! Not the book... the character... this was the first time for me where I really stood back and said \"He's growing up. He's realizing not everything around him should be believed without a hint of doubt.\" When he protected Sirius in the Shrieking Shack, it all changed for me. \\n 2. Dementors are awesome. I love the concept of stealing someone's soul through sucking their physical body off its bones. \\n 3. Transfiguration is a focus point, and I love seeing people turn into animals. It's like our core is bursting to show itself. \\n 4. Remus was my favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He was someone I'd want to hang out with... you know, and be a werewolf and all. \\n 5. History is revealed in many family connections and secrets. And since that's my favorite thing... this book was the most eye-opening for me. \\n See, that wasn't so bad to re-read a little bit of Harry Potter. I promise the next one won't be so hard. Only 4 left to write a review for. \\n About Me \\n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find TV & Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world.

Thanks for stopping by. \\n [polldaddy poll=9729544] \\n [polldaddy poll=9719251] || I read this as a buddy read, but really I wanted to compare the text to the movies more than anything. I've watched them so much and I've only read the series once through. (Now twice through this third book.) \\n So what do I think about this monstrosity of a series that gets so many hearts a-pumpin? About this book in particular? \\n I love it. \\n But how about this book in comparison to the film, you ask? \\n ALAS! I like the movie better. \\n What??? Blasphemy! Heretic! \\n No no no, give me a chance. I liked the fact that Hermione develops real stressed-out reasons for giving up the time-turner even if the reasons are still rather weak, all told, when taken in conjunction with all the other crap that happens in the series later. It'll always be one of those hedge-moments for me. BUT, putting that aside, the actual narrative events that happen in the book that I think are the best parts, namely the space of a certain 3 hour stretch, BOTH times, was much more fascinating and fleshed out in the movie. \\n Sorry! It's true! All the expressions and the little tidbits and quirks were more brilliant on the screen. And so was the penultimate event that always... ALWAYS brings tears to my eyes... the moment when Harry realizes that he was the one to bring out that awesome power to save himself. Even now I tear up when I think about it. \\n Yes, the book has it, but the build up was just too quick in the text. The movie, however, did what movies are brilliant at.... SHOWING us the enormity of the event. Sometimes it just takes the right media. \\n The movie is my favorite of the series. I'm reserving judgement as to whether the book is as well. (At least until I finish my re-read. :) || Is there any way to write a review on any of the Harry Potter books without doing it injustice? Nearly nobody attempts to create a full review on this series because of 1) its popularity, 2) its huge fanbase and 3) its awesomeness in general. And neither will I do so. The first book was fantastic, although I read it probably ten years too late in my life. The second book was not so fantastic, but still a great book. And the third one ... completely blew my mind. \\n I wanted to write a review on this book; I even started a checklist to keep track of what I wanted to add here. But the further I delved into the stories about the Prisoner of Azkaban, the more did I realize that the only things I was going to say were 'X is awesome', 'Y rocks' and 'Z simply has to be the winner'. The only aspect which might be criticized about this book might be the fact that some characters like Voldemort, Malfoy or, on the other hand, Harry, Hermione or Ron are relatively black or white, evil or good. But I don't mind. Because. Those. Characters. Are. Amazing. Hagrid and Lupin are my new favorites after reading this book. And I want more of Hedwig, because - owls! \\n In contrast to the two previous books, the pace is so wonderfully matching in this book. Just at the right time before the descriptions of the Hogwarts school year (all of them contributing to the entire plot) might turn too extensive, the story climbs up to its climax and concludes within one hundred pages of incredible tension. Logical relevations, long-desired confrontations and a lot of surprises will accompany you during your journey with Harry and his friends, resulting in the convergence of several different plotlines which were established during the course of the novel. \\n Most of the people I know have read this book, but if you happen to be one of the few exceptions, then go read it. Maybe you fear it because of its fantasy elements? I've never been a fan of fantasy either, but this book series changed my opinion. Maybe you fear it because of its popularity? Don't be afraid. The hype is completely justified. \\n My reviews in the Harry Potter series: \\n 1) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: Go to review \\n 2) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: Go to review || Shit got real! \\n For me, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was when the series got exciting! It certainly got darker and more mature. Torture, loss, a foreboding sense of dread and death itself descended upon this happy little world of magic where school exams and difficult professors were the worst things to worry about until recently. \\n I'm a big fan of the tone. The series jumps right into its bigboy pants here. As an adult reading these books, I was glad to see the maturity. Yeah, it's still YA and not targeted towards me, but at least now it felt a little closer to something in my old man range. \\n As mentioned before, there's an ever present element of death in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Those ghoulish dementors are death itself. However, it also introduced a reason for Harry to want to live: his godfather, a connection to his parents. Up until then there was little joy in Harry's life. Sure there was the school, but that would end soon enough. Rowling did a smart thing when she introduced Sirius Black, she gave Harry a human bond and something to lose. As readers our attachment grew with his. That was when Harry became real to me. || Re-read 2015 - 5 always magical stars \\n Let's not talk about how Sirius kept his sanity (most of it anyway) in Azkaban to avenge his best friends. \\n Or how he asked Harry to stay with him for the summer \\n And the thing that happened in the later books... \\n Let's not... || 5 STARS!!! \\n My Favorite book and movie in the HP series!!

None of us have read or finished the Harry Potter series, and as teachers it is about time we read one of the most popular YA book series. \\n This book starts off like the other two Harry Potter books. Harry is at his Aunt and Uncle's place and gets rescued from their evil ways and makes his way to the wizarding world. This book has a similar pattern to the other books. Harry is involved in Quidditch and in every game he faces challenges from the outside. He also has a villain in this book that is not Lord V. Black is a murderer escaped from Azkaban and is being pursued by the soul-sucking Dementors who guarded him in prison. \\n Harry faces multiple challenges and problems and overcomes them with greatness.

The cast of characters and world really expanded in this one and there were some moments of brilliance. My one complaint was the pacing, as something great would happen and then there'd be long stretches of time without much plot development. I still don't feel like I'm aboard the HP fandom train but I think I might be getting there. Also psyched I finally know what the Marauders Map is. || Yep, still my favourite.   \n",
       "1  Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. \\n Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. \\n Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. \\n Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor. || Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. AlisonaEUR(tm)s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldnaEUR(tm)t put it down. Obviously, as the classaEUR(tm)s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. \\n Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. \\n This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If weaEUR(tm)re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they donaEUR(tm)t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesnaEUR(tm)t apply to them, and in some ways thataEUR(tm)s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. \\n And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesnaEUR(tm)t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonistaEUR(tm)s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. \\n As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. IaEUR(tm)ve read it six more times since then, and itaEUR(tm)s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If youaEUR(tm)re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If youaEUR(tm)re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest. \\n For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings. || I.love.this.book. \\n Seriously, I read this maybe in fourth grade? It was definitly in elementary school, because I remember it was at the same time that we we doing \"survival skills\"* in Girl Scouts. Not that I ever wanted to be trapped by myself in the wilderness, but I spent a lot of my time in my backyard pretending to find flint with my sister, and starting imaginary fires to keep warm. In winter we dug ourselves igloos. I always went camping with my parents, so this book started a lot of Q&A's with them about what to do if I get lost in the woods (Hint, No. 1 is STAY WHERE YOU ARE!). Any ways, its a great read for an elementary kid, and everyone should read it. \\n * This was put in quotation marks because it was a total joke. I had been looking forward to these skills for quite some time, finally girl scouts was going to teach me what I wanted! Instead of knives they handed us popsicle sticks. For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire. Basically we made banana boats, and then the instructor put the boats in and out of the coals for us. We learned how to build a fire with coals, not tinder. Agh. It was at this point that I decided Girl Scouts was NOT for me. || Gary Paulsen writes in only two emotions: fine and vomit-y. Someone may want to tell him that there are other ways to provoke a response in a reader than going right for the gut, so to speak. This book could have done with some fear and suspense, perhaps some gratification, depression, or joy. I do not mind a tragedy, nor do I balk at watching the man beaten down. I am a fan of Chekhov's. \\n If your idea of suspense is mosquito bites on your nipples, meet your Stephen King. || ok I read this like 8 years ago but I remember it pretty well? it's not bad but survival books aren't my thing so this was kinda boring || A story of a boy that survives a small plane crash into the wilderness. The pilot (and only other person on the plane) had a heart attack and died. Every struggle and triumph are fascinating. A must read for young readers. One of the books I will never forget. || I can see why kids would love it, but the tale of survival didn't entirely grab me. || So when I added this, I vaguely recalled the title, and I swear, I have definitely read it, but what I thought it was about was a boy being stuck under the snow following an avalanche (it turns out the book I was thinking of is apty named Avalanche by Arthur Roth) but anyway, that's not what it is about, and I really don't remember this book at all. \\n Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet: \\n 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. \\n 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? \\n 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. \\n 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies) \\n 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). \\n 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? \\n Get it! So good! || This was a book that my 9 year old and I read together and I have to tell you, he was riveted. It's a classic by now (first published in the 80s) and for good reason...it keeps the reader on the edge of their seat for the entire book. \\n If you're not familiar, here's the premise: child of divorcing parents is sent from his New York City home during summer vacation up to visit his father on a work site in the northern Canadian wilderness via a small, single-engine airplane. Enroute, the pilot suffers a heart attack and dies. The plane crashes in the wilderness, off-course. Child survives but no rescue crew can find him. The only tools he has are a hatchet and his wits. He must learn to survive. \\n Wow. Talk about riveting. My son spent the entire book trying to anticipate what was going to happen, whether the survival techniques he was using in the book were smart or not, whether they'd work, how it could be done better, etc and so on. In other words, it made him think. \\n As for the veracity of the book, Paulsen did his homework. The airplane scene, which stretches on for some time, is spot on. As a pilot, I'm always dismayed by authors who try to write about flying scenes and don't even take the time to ask a real pilot (such as easy, quick question that all pilots would be happy to answer to make the scene realistic) basic questions...it frequently makes me toss a book aside. Either Paulsen flies himself or thought to ask and the result is a realistic crash scene. Bravo! He also describes in an afterward to the book all the research he did on the survival techniques his character uses in the book...he tested each one himself, even the foods his character eats (eeeewww, trust me, eeeeeww). Perhaps this is why the book is so loved all these years later....it's realistic. Kids love it. I loved it. \\n Age range for reading? I'm thinking 3rd grade and up. I've seen it read in classrooms starting around 3rd grade and that is the age where my son could really grasp the implications of what was going on. Also, due to the divorce issues also going on (Mom has a 'boyfriend' which is why the marriage is breaking up), it would probably be difficult for a younger child to understand what is going on there. \\n Highly recommended. || This a great survival story that really holds the interest of young boys. The writing itself wasn't extremely well done, but the plot made up for it decently enough. \\n Interest Level Grades 5 - 8 \\n Grade Level Equivalent 5.7 \\n http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/bo... || Still fantastic after all these years || If I could rate it 0 stars, I would. The only reason I read this is for school. Trust me, I wouldn't have if Mrs. Jones (not her real name), my fifth grade teacher hadn't made me. It's just so repetitive. Every chapter, excluding the first few and the last, are the same thing: he wakes up, looks for food, runs into some animal, get's hurt and then this \"secret\" thing that they keep bringing up? Seriously, just mention it once and move on, Paulsen. Anyway, I hated this book. Luckily, I'll never have to read the sequel... (Que forshaddow-y music) || I read this with my son and year or two ago. I know that I read it once as a kid myself but it was so long ago I was really fuzzy on the details. So here's my sons (10 y/o ish) thoughts on the book: \\n I really dig the survival aspect of books, especially how it was presented this book. My heart was pounding, waiting to see if he survived. I didn't know how it was going to end so it kept me anxious and excited. I really think he should have stopped eating those berries though. Gross. Overall it was a fantastic read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. || As many of you might know, I abhor the YA designation, believing it to be a form of segregation that simply makes it a target for the Comstockians of the world, witness recent calls for YA books to be more wholesome and less dark. That many so-called YA titles deal with issues that should be of concern to teens seems of little concern to those who want to prevent their sixteen-year-olds from reading about what they experience everyday. The YA designation, I suspect, has, in the past, steered many adult readers away from books so designated, not wanting to be seen as stooping below their level. (I use young adult and adult only in their chronological sense, certainly not from the standpoint of maturity level.) \\n Our reading club decided to discuss a couple of books that had been enjoyed by some of our members from that standpoint. We chose two: Hatchet and Waiting to Forget (review to follow), each in its own way a survival novel, both in a wilderness, but one made of trees, the other of people. \\n The differences are substantial with Waiting to Forget much more adult both in content and style. Hatchet is a great story for 10 year-olds (and young 60 year-olds) about a young boy (age thirteen) being sent to his father in Canada following a nasty divorce. The pilot of the single engined plane dies of a heart attack, and young Brian must find a way to stay alive in the wilderness (a remarkably non-hostile environment with the exception of a moose and tornado) with only a hatchet fortuitously given to him by his mother for survival. The book is told in third-person from Brian's perspective so it's hardly a spoiler to say young Brian, a very smart kid, indeed, survives by using his wits and, fortuitously, the hatchet given to him by his mother as a present before he left to visit his father. \\n It's a good survival story although some of the elements like \"the Secret\" were peripheral and distracted from the story line. The Epilogue was totally unnecessary and redundant, I thought. The last line before it would have made a perfect ending. My understanding is that Paulson followed up with the success of Hatchet with a couple of sequels. \\n As I read this enjoyable little book, I wondered if Paulson had become enamored of Tom Brown who achieved some fame as being a great \"tracker\" and wilderness expert. Raised in the Jersey Pine Barrens, he was ostensibly the grandson of an Apache named \"Stalking Wolf.\"(I'm not kidding.) Brown wrote several pieces on wilderness survival for Mother Jones in the eighties. I remember several nature types on the faculty asking me to order his books many years ago, although the luster seemed to tarnish some when it was learned Brown was fond of smoking. \\n Looking up Tom Brown for this review I discovered he has capitalized on his knowledge. http://www.trackertrail.com/tombrown/... \\n Tom Brown books: Tom Brown's Field guide to wilderness survival and Tracker and Tom Brown's Field Guide To Living With The Earth || For the last few months, I have been going into my son's classroom and reading with a small group for an hour. This is exactly my kind of volunteering. We each take turns reading aloud and when the hour is up, we mark our place for the next week. \\n Our group, which contained five boys and myself, read The Hatchet, a book about 13 year-old Brian Robeson, who survives in the Canadian wilderness for months after the airplane he was traveling in to visit his father crashes - in large part because he has in his possession a hatchet given to him by his mother. \\n I was very impressed with those 8 and 9 year-old attention spans because, after the initial crash, which is quite exciting, the book moves at a snails pace. There are lots and lots of details about Brian building a shelter and the process in which he finds food (from berries, eggs, fish to finally game meat) and Brian's own inner dialogue about what his fate will be. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the author, Gary Paulsen, uses a technique of repeating emphasis words regularly throughout paragraphs that the boys were able to pick up as a unique to that author writing style. It was so fun to discuss those kinds of things with these bright boys. Paulsen also included plenty of vomiting, diarrhea, animal attacks and other bits of danger to completely hook his young readers. \\n I admit to being a tad worried about the theme of divorce and The Secret (which turned out to be that Brian saw his mother kissing another man in a car), but was relieved to discover that it wasn't the emphasis of the book and even my sheltered and innocent son seemed able to handle these mature ideas. \\n I'm not as sure girls of the same age would like it, but The Hatchet was a hit with my 8 year old. Plus, mom liked it too. || What an outstanding read. I have read it at least 3 x. || This is one of those books that all kids apparently read in school at a certain age. It wasn't written till the late 80s, so I was at that certain age too early. \\n This is a survival story. Brian is a passenger in a prop plane that crashes in the (I guess) Canadian wilderness. He's the only survivor, and has to learn everything he needs to make it in the wild on his own. \\n Other readers have complained that Brian as a character is pretty bland, that he's not very well fleshed out. But the book is not about Brian; it's about the ability of someone (in this case, a thirteen-year-old city boy) to survive with next to no resources and almost no skills. \\n I really enjoyed this book, as an adventure story for young readers. I had a couple quibbles - mostly Paulsen's habit of repeating phrases; he repeats phrases; repeats them - but overall, this was a good, fairly quick read. I'm curious to know what the rest of the books in the series will add to the story. || Review to come || A nostalgic read for me, as I really loved this book when I was younger and wanted to reread it. I think this is where my love of survival stories came from! I had a bit of fun rereading this, even if some parts dragged a bit on the reread. I will always have fond memories of this book! || One of those books that I was tired of people referencing. When I talked to my students, almost all the boys said Gary Paulsen was their favorite author, so I had to go back and read some of his stuff myself. I never had. I guess when I was the right age to read it, I was off with Tamora Pierce. \\n What's the fuss? It's incredibly simplistic in style and plot, but maybe that's just because I'm twice as old as the intended age range. I read it in about an hour. Survivalist, hunting types would enjoy this, but I think I'd prefer to push kids into something that made them think a bit harder. Not that this is brain junk by any means, but I'd think of it more as a bridge to better literature. Kids would get excited about this, love this, and then you can eventually switch it out for something a bit more involved.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                     Just stumbled upon this book by accident, thank you, Goodreads! Have been trying to remember the title for the longest time! I read this several times in grade school, it fascinated me! Ivy Carson is from a, well, trashy family, but she herself is very different. She tells the mousy Martha who is her best friend that she is the daughter of the fairy queen, and has been switched with the real Ivy Carson. Ivy is a gifted but unschooled dancer, with wild black hair and capricious moods. She reminded me, in a way, of my own best friend in junior high. There is something timeless and beautiful about this book, and how Ivy and Martha change over the years. I just adored this little book, and I should find a copy for my daughter, when she's a bit older. || This is the book that first introduced me to Zilpha Keatley Snyder, who was my absolute favorite author as a kid. This book is not a fantasy, but it did inspire a fantasy series, the excellent Green Sky trilogy. Marty \"the mouse\" becomes friends with Ivy Carson, an unusual girl from a large and notorious family, who claims to be a changeling. I really can't do the book justice, but I think anyone who's felt like an outcast, or had a life-changing friendship (or wanted one) will love this book. || ** spoiler alert ** \\n I don't remember when I first read this book. I think I got it from the Scholastic Book Company when I was in second grade (1971 or 1972); we lived in a very rural area in northern New Mexico and my mother basically allowed me to order every book I wanted when the Scholastic catalog came. I know I then read it many, many times over the years that followed... and then, of course, at some point it got packed away with the rest of my \"kid's books\" and I haven't touched it in ages. \\n But now, as it goes, I'm \"old enough for fairy tales again\" (not that I really ever stopped - I'm not a Gryffindor for nothing), and I found it again when I was recommended other books by Keatley-Snyder. While looking those up, I found \"The Changeling\" again. \\n I knew this book had been very formative for my young mind, I just had forgotten quite how MUCH. I was Martha -- chubby, frightened of everything, burst into tears at the slightest thing; the main difference was I was the oldest child in the family, and, of course, I never had an Ivy. \\n I wanted to be like Martha when I was young, because I was sure I would grow up like she did, tall and slim and loved by everyone... but I never made it THERE. I stayed chubby, but I did end up in all the plays in high school, as a character actor. I made up stories, I wrote them down, I dreamed and wished and never wanted to grow up (and really, that spell DOES work)... I never got thin, but I eventually met my own \"Ivy.\" I didn't meet her early enough to dream with me on that childhood level, but we plan on growing old together, if possibly never grown UP together (because she loved the book, too). \\n I know I don't say a whole lot about the actual book here, but my review is based on feelings and impressions rather than the events in the story. Needless to say, it still holds up just as beautifully as it did then -- sure, now it only took me about two hours to read instead of weeks... but I still lost myself just as deeply within the beautiful lines that Keatley-Snyder wove here. I only wish I could be as brilliant a storyteller (not to say I don't TRY). \\n I still love this book - I love the story, the characters, my feelings and impressions when I read it and how it makes me feel afterward. Beautiful, dreamy, mystic, alien, lost, found, sure of myself, unsure, scared, exhilarated, joyous... everything. Everything. I think this book may have been everything to my growing up. I've never lost it. \\n Know all the questions, but never the answers. || read this just out of my teens, and loved it to pieces. My paperback is falling apart, alas, so I have not reread it for some twenty years. So I don't know how it holds up to my adult view, but the friendship, the approach to being different and creativity were impressive to me when young.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Mostly during primary school my chosen prospective career was saint. \\n Ah, but then there was the period where I discovered Heidi and as I read and reread it a bunch of times, I most fervently wanted to become a goatherd, with all that this entailed. The bell. The sleeping snuggled into warm hay in the attic. The eating of too much cheese. \\n So taken was I with the idea of Switzerland that when we were asked, about grade 6, where we were going for the term holiday, I - who had never been on a holiday because we were way too poor - said Switzerland. I just might have gotten away with this but for the fact that my mother taught in the senior school. Since I had further elaborated when pressed, that we were going by boat - another fixation I had throughout childhood, seafaring - and the term holiday was a mere fortnight, news soon spread through the school that my mother was leaving her teaching job. In case you don't get the plot so far, I was weaving this fantasy in Australia where I was born and raised. \\n Never mind the trouble I got into for this, it didn't in the least affect my taste for anything Swittish. \\n Since then, as an adult I've been able to visit Switzerland five times, mostly Geneva. By no means goatherd territory, but still. You can see Geneva as a straightforwardly beautiful city. You can see it through Australian eyes as having that aesthetic qualities of age that our cities so lack, not to mention the mountain backdrop the like of which we would never see at home. Or you can see it, I discover, as a young child would whose dreams were always of other places. I confess as I've wandered about the city, staring at those snow-capped mountains, to feeling that I have come home in some way that I'm sure derives from the profound effect this utterly magical book had on me when I read it so long ago. \\n I don't know if other people wonder if they have let down the small bundles of hopes and dreams they once were, but I do. It breaks my heart, the idea that I might have disappointed that little hopeful dreaming thing I was once, and I have found it a very emotional experience being in this dream I once went to sleep with every night. I really can't remember, but I hope she - I - did always believe dreams come true. Yeah, well. Sometimes they do. || A heartwarming classic children's book that is meaningful for adults... \\n I loved Heidi as a child. This book was a dog-eared favorite! I did enjoy revisiting this book recently as part of a group read, as an adult. However, I do think that the magic of the book is best for children. I will fully disclose that 1 of the stars is completely nostalgic! \\n What I loved: \\n * The beautiful descriptions of the setting -- the Alps in Switzerland \\n * The fact that Heidi had such a positive impact on those around her -- the \"Alm-Uncle\" (her grandfather), Peter's grandma, Clara, Peter (she taught him to read), the doctor \\n * Feeling uplifted after reading the story \\n * The hope, positive attitude, and altruism of Heidi -- always looking to make a difference and help people \\n What I didn't care for as much: \\n * The one-dimensionality of some of the characters -- i.e., Aunt Dete \\n * The quickness and the magnitude of the change in some characters (for the better) was hard to believe -- i.e., the Alm Uncle \\n * The innumerable references to God \\n * Heidi -- never acted like a child and was too angelic to be believable \\n I love to imagine the pure beauty of Heidi's life in the Alps with her grandfather. \\n I recommend this book to all children!! Also, to readers of Classics or Children's Literature in general. Wikipedia touts Heidi as being one of the bestselling books ever written and one of the best known works of Swiss literature. || THE SUNDAY FAMILY READ \\n Heidi was one of my most read books as a child. I think our family owned it so I could just pick it up and read it whenever I wanted to. I remember being entranced by the fact that Heidi's aunt made her wear ALL her clothes so there would be nothing to carry on the journey to Grandfather. It was a hot spring day when Heidi made that first climb up the mountain to her grandfather's cabin. I felt sorry for her being so over-dressed but I knew right away that the aunt was a \"bad person.\" \\n As soon as they got to Grandfather, even though he was thought of as a \"bad person,\" I could tell he was good. It only made the aunt more bad for leaving her niece with someone considered to be dangerous. \\n There you have the wonder of Johanna Spyri's writing. She didn't come right out and say who was bad, good, or otherwise but showed these qualities by her storytelling. Her heavy religious message did not bother me as a child because it fit right in with what I had been taught. It didn't bother me during this rereading either, even when Clara's grandmother was clearly preaching Christian theology, because it is done with so much love and understanding while doing no one any harm. \\n I did notice that the first half of the book is more interesting and exciting while the second half has more lessons, as it were, and gets a bit serious. It turns out that Ms Spyri wrote two books: Heidi's Years of Learning and Travel, then Heidi Make Use of What She Has Learned, later combined into one. Those titles hint at the shift in emphasis. I did always like the first half the most, but remember being so happy when everything turned out well for Heidi, Peter, Clara and all the grandparents. \\n In any case, I loved it just as much as ever, I cried a few times, and was overjoyed to spend time with someone whom I once considered a friend. || Heidi is definitely a classic; most people I know have read it as a child themselves and it's a story of a girl who tries to make the best out of a bad situation, creating a very interesting little adventure. || I'd set out with just my e-reader and a camera to find some outdoor cafe in the remote mountains of the Balkans. After finding the only apparent cafe in the village, on the other side of several cow pastures, I decided to just keep going to the waterfall, no matter how long it took. It took a long time. Clouds gathered, the path directives had lost their arrowheads, and the few stragglers coming back looked weary of the effort. \\n It started to rain, really hard. I crossed the rocks of the muddy stream bed and headed uphill towards the falls anyway. It was raining and thundering too hard to feel safe. Through purest luck, I saw a rock overhang and dry rock for sitting just off the trail. Sopping wet, I considered the vagaries of mountain rain clouds (\"if you don't like the weather, wait 10 minutes\") and wondered if there were too many drips falling from the rocks to read an ereader under it, eventually. I did. Having been really frightened by the narrow switchback roads hugging the cliffs coming up by car that morning, despite the high, stark beauty, I'd then seen my first mountain men in their element, taciturn lords of glorified cabins. I needed a reminder of why a trip to remote mountains was worth it, and maybe Heidi was the book I needed. By that time I'd met someone like the angry grandfather and the goats on mountain passes. I was so transported, I didn't realize the rain had stopped until other refuges from above started hiking back down to the village, stopping to stare at me. Per usual, the characters in the book took my fancy, but the scenery was no match for the rain-free reality around me soon after, though the book may have heightened my awareness at least. \\n For all the dubious claims of healthy sun and fresh air which events in Heidi contain, I myself limped back to a city 2 days later, unable to sleep or walk, despite years of walking 2-3km a day, and years prior living at much higher altitudes. I'd always been suspicious that 19th century tuberculosis cases got better in low oxygen environments, but never thought oxygen deprivation or rich yogurt would plague my legs. Finishing Heidi's adventures from a balcony in the city, I had the bizarre experience of suddenly missing the mountain setting, and so, had to put down Heidi until it made me less homesick for the high, sleepless, rainy mountain I'd just left. \\n Since then I've read a British woman's account of the same Balkan mountains, some 20 years after Heidi was written. Mountain men were indeed violent and tribal, and certainly not strictly in the Balkans. They were also clothed and fed a lot better than grandmamma in Heidi, no matter how poor they'd been. \\n It brings up the question of how Heidi and friends could get so healthy and fat eating so little. I did love the distinctive yogurt they served, but even if it took 2 hours of offroading to reach a market, it still could have been store bought. Mostly I'm reminded of an exceptionally large number of simple dishes, so many in fact that I never ate more than a single meal every day. \\n The writer of Heidi was from a small mountain village. The Swiss do in fact live quite a long time. The air must have been remarkably fresher than in Frankfurt, which must have smelled a lot more of banker than any city today. I could no longer sense the difference in mountain air, although I did begin to pick up scents on the trail, after believing that my sense of smell had been lost many years ago. \\n Here are a few questions to consider when you read Heidi: \\n What made grandfather so angry? \\n Is Peter a model for boys? Is Heidi? \\n Did Heidi sound too young for her age? \\n Did she sound unusually concerned about adults around her? \\n How did the doctor help grandmamma? \\n What kind of conversations did grandfather and the doctor have? \\n What does it say that the mountain folk are gossips and the city folk are miracle workers? || My copy of Heidi is actually a hardback with beautiful illustrations. I loved this book. Probably very unrealistic, with an overly idyllic picture of the setting -- but lovely all the same. || Cuon truyen thieu nhi nhe nhang voi cai ket nhu truyen co tich. Se nho mai Heidi, Clara, bac Alm, Peter, ba noi cua Peter va Clara, mon pho mat va sua de cua bac Alm va vung Dorfli day Alps (Heidi's Land tai Thuy Si). || Wonderful children's tale of a young girl growing up in the Swiss Alps with her grandfather. I first read this classic more than 60 years ago when I was a child. Such solid messages of Christian faith and virtue seldom seen in literature for children today. I loved this book then and I loved it now. || `l~ lrWuGm mn nh tuSnWaf fy qsm qSS l'Tfl lknny qr'th t`wyDan lnfsy l'nWy lm 't`rWf `lyh fy Tfwlty .. '`Ttny sh`wran jmylan .. s'ftqdh [?][?] || This book has sold more than fifty million copies worldwide, has been translated into over fifty languages, and has been enjoyed by generations of children. Heidi is a charming story is about an orphaned girl who is sent away from her aunt to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps. Heidi's grandfather is a cold hearted and mean man when they first meet. Slowly they get to know one another and the love between Heidi and her grandfather grows. Heidi also becomes friends with two other children, Peter and Clara. When Peter, who is Heidi's grandfather's shepherd, starts to become jealous of her relationship with wheelchair bound Clara, he sets in motion a terrible, yet ultimately wonderful event. \\n This is one of those classic books that I would highly recommend to anyone, from a ten year old to an adult. It demonstrates the power of friendship. Unlike the angst driven young characters of today, Heidi is a heartwarming girl who is always grateful and contented, no matter what her situation. Is it realistic? Probably not, but it's still a lovely story. The first time I read Heidi was 55 years ago and occasionally I like to go to my \"nostalgia\" bookshelf and recapture a moment of childhood magic. It's hard to find a more magical story than \"Heidi\". || A saccharine, yet strangely readable, children's book about a little Swiss girl who transforms the lives of nearly everyone she meets. I'd read this one as a kid but remembered too little to count it for my world books challenge without a re-read. The beauty of the mountain and Heidi's love for it are vividly depicted. Spyri doesn't talk down to her child readers, and I wouldn't have guessed this to be a translation without being told (though there are some ways of writing that passed in the 19th century but wouldn't today: \"'That would be all very well if he were like other people,' asseverated stout Barbel warmly\"). It continues to surprise me that so many favorite children's books are so old, and yet children have no trouble with them, while adult classics are more difficult and less widely read. This one is probably best enjoyed by readers of an age to readily identify with Heidi, but despite some idealization and religious messaging it was a pleasant enough read as an adult too. || A fast paced story with beautiful snapshots of alpes mountainous area. If only the story was a bit longer with more details. But considering reading it to a kid, the length is enough. \\n A story that brings tears to my eyes and Given that not all kid stories can do it, 4.5 stars. || Such a sweet story, and one that the whole family will love to read together. || This was always one of my least-favorite classics. Oh well. It's still a good book, and I like it... but not really my cup of tea. I don't get bored easily by books. This one, unfortunately, bored me largely to death. || So, it turns out, there are really good reasons why certain books become classics. This was a delightful book to study with my littles. || I thought this book was so exotic at the time. || Loved this as a kid. It's a bit cloying for current times, though. || For some reason, I decided yesterday that I needed to reread this. I know I read it and loved it as a kid, but I did not at ALL remember the heavy handed Christianity that was half the book. I must have zoomed on by it in favor of the nature descriptions. \\n So, yeah, this was totally a moral tale. And just about everyone, outside of Peter and Uncle Alp, were either nearly perfect or nearly all bad. Heidi just barely managed to not be cloying though - she could be pretty bitchy sometimes, and that helped a lot. I'd always had this little Heidi/Peter memory vibe from this story, but he was kind of a possessive, selfish jerk. \\n Between this and Anne, I guess it's no wonder that I love nature so much. But not so much that I trust it allows a girl who is paralyzed to walk again. Sigh. Still, the chapters in town are perfectly oppressive and depressing, and the mountain chapters uplifting and beautiful. It was clearly well translated, and I did enjoy the reread. || What a good story about a young girl's childhood and her relationship with her loving grandfather. || Published in 1880, it's full of Victorian sentimentality. Heidi, an innocent and artless child brings joy to poor crippled Clara. She persuades her grumpy old grandfather to start going to church again. She persuades rough-around-the-edges goatherd Peter to learn to read. She spends her money on soft white rolls for his poor blind old grandma. She revels in the glory of nature. And she gets the better of the horrible servant with the give-away name Rottenmeier who deserves to be laughed at. Absolutely loved it as a child, but not sure it's stood the test of time.   \n",

Kind of like being inside the head of a writer/poet who is mentally unstable or having a nervous breakdown. Some of the hand drawings were creative though.   \n",

       "      <td>Lowry's book is a piece of nationalist propaganda, using oversimplification, emotional appeals, and dualistic morality to shut down her readers' minds. More troubling is that it is aimed at children, who don't yet have the critical faculties to defend themselves from such underhanded methods. \\n Unsurprisingly, Lowry adopts the structure of the monomyth, equating a spiritual journey with a moral one. Her Christ-figure uses literal magic powers to rebel against his society. This rebellion and the morality behind it are presented as 'natural', to contrast with the 'abnormal morality' around him. \\n Lowry doesn't seem to understand that we get our morality from our culture, it isn't something in-born that we 'lose'. This is the first hint of Lowry's misunderstanding of the human mind. She assumes her own morality is correct, and then builds her story to fit it. \\n She also makes the character act and think like a modern person would, despite never adequately explaining how he came up with such unusual notions. It's the same trick many historical fiction authors use, leaving us scratching our heads as to why a Fourteenth Century French peasant speaks like a second-wave feminist. I'd suggest that Lowry falls to this fault for the same reason they do: she has no talent for imagining how others might think differently. \\n Lowry's book ends with the standard nonspecific transgressive spiritual event that marks any overblown monomyth. Since the book is not a progressive presentation of ideas, it does not suggest any conclusion. Instead, the climax is a symbolic faux-death event (symbolic of what, none can say). Confusingly, Lowry later redacts the ending in the sequels, undermining the pseudo-spiritual journey she created. \\n Though some call this book 'Dystopian', it's closer to the truth to say Lowry borrows elements from the Dystopian authors, attempting to combine the spiritual uplift of the monomyth with the political and social deconstruction of the Dystopia. What she doesn't recognize is that the faith of the one conflicts with the cynicism of the other. She draws on ideas and images from many other authors: Bradbury, Huxley, Orwell, Burgess, but doesn't improve upon them. \\n These authors created novels that reflected the world around them. They based them on the political events of the times, presented with realism and careful psychology. Though they presented the struggle between the individual and the society, they portrayed morality as grey, and suffering as the result of individual human faults, not political systems. Lowry doesn't realize that the best way to critique Fascism or Communism is not to present it as 'evil', but to simply present it as it was. \\n But Lowry's world is not based in reality, it is symbolic and hyperbolic. Instead of writing about how poverty makes the world seem small and dull, she has the characters magically unable to experience life. Instead of an impersonal government, she presents a sort of evil hippy commune. \\n The only political system it resembles is a school, which is a neat little trick to get the kids interested. The idea that 'school=unfeeling totalitarian hell' is not an uncommon one, but it's one I'm surprised teachers would support. The book also suggests a creche, but lacking similarity to any real-world system, it doesn't work as a political criticism. \\n Lowry creates this artificial world to suit her purposes, but it is not a symbolic exercise like 'Animal Farm'. We understand that the pigs of animal farm are symbolic, because there are no talking pigs. Lowry's world is more insidious, since its oversimplification is hidden. She builds an artificial world to support the dualist morality that she's pushing. She presents the same knee-jerk fears about euthanasia and abortion that people use against Women's Rights or Health Care. \\n Worse than these Straw Man arguments is the fact that she never deals with the economic causes of totalitarianism. Tyrants don't just rise up and take control by their own force of will, they come into power because of the socioeconomic situations that surround them. Lean times produce strong, fascist leaders while profitable times produce permissive, liberal societies. \\n Strong, centralized leadership simply doesn't self-propagate in cultures where everyone is clothed, fed, and housed. The Holocaust was socially about some ideal of 'change' and 'purity', but it was economically about the transmission of wealth from Jews, Poles, and Catholics to Germans (and more specifically, to those Germans who had elected the new ruling party). \\n The atrocities of war are, for the most part, committed by normal people on other normal people. By presenting the power structure as 'amoral' and 'inhuman', Lowry ignores the fact that people will willingly cause others to suffer. Painting the enemy as 'evil' and 'alien' is just an unsophisticated propagandist method. \\n She contrasts her 'evil' with the idealized 'goodness' of emotion, beauty, and freedom. This is nothing more than the American dream of 'specialness' that Mr. Rogers was pushing for so many years. We are all special, we are all good, we all deserve love and happiness. Sure, it sounds good, but what does it mean? \\n Where does this 'specialness' come from? If it is just the 'sanctity of human life', then it's not really special, because it's all-encompassing. If all of us are special, then none of us are. There's nothing wrong with valuing life, but when Lowry presents one mode of life as valuable and another as reprehensible, she ceases to actually value humanity as a whole. Instead, she values a small, idealized chunk of humanity. 'People are good, except the ones I don't like' is not a moral basis, nor is it a good message to send to kids. \\n If the specialness is only based on fitting in with a certain moral and social guideline, then Lowry isn't praising individuality, she's praising herd behavior. The protagonist is only 'special' because he has magic powers. His specialness is not a part of his character, it is an emotional appeal. \\n The idea of being a special individual is another piece of propaganda, and its one kids are especially prone to, because kids aren't special: they are carefully controlled and powerless. Giving a character special powers and abilities and then using that character to feed a party line to children is not merely disingenuous, it's disturbing. \\n There is also a darker side to universal specialness: giving a child a sense of importance without anything to back it up creates egotism and instability. Adults noticed that children with skills and friends had high self-esteems, but instead of teaching their children social skills and knowledge, they misunderstood the causal relationship and tried to give them self-worth first. \\n Unfortunately, the moment unsupported self-worth is challenged, the child finds they have nothing to fall back on. Their entitlement didn't come from their skills or experiences, and so they have nothing to bolster that sense of worth. Instead, any doubt sends them down a spiral of emotional instability. \\n A single book like this wouldn't be the cause of such a state in a child, but it does act as part of the social structure built to give a sense of worth without a solid base for that worth. People like to believe they are special, kids especially so, but being a remarkable person is not a result of belief but of actions. If the book had informed them, then it would leave them better off, but giving them a conclusion based on emotional appeals does nothing to build confidence or character. \\n Many people have told me this book is good because it appeals to children, but children often fall for propaganda. Children develop deep relationships with pop stars, breakfast cereals, and Japanese monsters. This does not make them good role models for children. \\n Feeding 'specialness' to kids along with a political message is no better than the fascist youth programs Lowry intends to criticize. The obsession with individuality is just another form of elitism. It's ironic that people in America most often describe themselves as individuals when pointing out the things they do to align themselves with groups. \\n But banding together in a community is not a bad thing. For Lowry and other 'Red Scare' children, any mention of 'communal' can turn into a witch hunt, but we all give up some personal rights and some individuality in order to live in relatively safe, structured societies. There are benefits to governmental social controls and there are drawbacks, and it's up to us to walk the line between the two. Anarchy and Totalitarianism never actually exist for long: we are social animals. \\n It's not difficult to understand why Lowry is so popular, especially amongst educators. The message she gives aligns perfectly with what they were taught as kids, from Red Scare reactionism to the hippy-dippy 'unique snowflake' mantra. These ideas aren't entirely misguided, either. It's good to recognize the benefits of difference and the dangers of allowing other to control our lives. \\n If a reader believes that fascism and socialism are inherently wrong and that their own individuality is their greatest asset, they will likely sympathize with Lowry's work. However, this doesn't make the book honest, nor beneficial. One of the hardest things we can do as readers is disagree with the methods of authors we agree with ideologically. \\n It makes us feel good to find authors who agree with us, but this is when we should be at our most skeptical. Searching the world for self-justification is not a worthwhile goal, it simply turns you into another short-sighted, argumentative know-it-all. 'Yes men' never progress. \\n Lowry is toeing the party line. She does not base her book around difficult questions, like the Dystopian authors, but around easy answers. She doesn't force the reader to decide for themselves what is best, she makes it clear what she wants us to think. Her book is didactic, which means that it instructs the reader what to believe. \\n Even if her conclusions about Individuality vs. Community are correct, she doesn't present arguments, she only presents conclusions. Like rote memorization or indoctrination, she teaches nothing about the politics, social order, economics, or psychology of totalitarianism or individuality. The reader is not left with an understanding, just an opinion. \\n The baseless 'individuality' of the book lets the reader imagine that they are rebels--that they are bucking the system even as they fall into lock-step. By letting the reader think they are already free-thinking, Lowry tricks them into forgetting their skepticism. \\n She is happy to paint a simple world of black and white, and this is likely the world she sees. I doubt she is purposefully creating an insidious text, she just can't see past her own opinions. She writes this book with a point to make, and makes it using emotional appeals and symbolism. She doesn't back it up with arguments because she doesn't seem to have developed her opinions from cogent arguments. \\n In the end, she doesn't show us that the structure of this society is wrong, she says nothing poignant about individuality vs. community; instead, she relies on threats to the life of an innocent infant. Yet nowhere does she provide an argument for why communal living or the sacrifice of freedoms for safety must necessarily lead to infanticide. \\n In politics, making extreme claims about the opposing side is called mud-slinging, it is an underhanded and dishonest tactic. It works. Arguing intelligently is difficult, accusing is easy, so that's what Lowry does. \\n She is another child of WWII and the Cold War who hasn't learned her lesson. She quickly condemns the flaws of others while failing to search out her own. Even after the Holocaust, there are many racist, nationalist, violent Jews; conflict rarely breeds a new understanding. \\n America condemned the faceless communal life of the Second World, and yet America created The Projects. We critiqued strong governmental controls, but we still have the bank bailout, socialized medicine, socialized schooling, and socialized charity. America condemned the Gulags and Work Camps, and yet we imprison one out of every hundred citizens; far more than Stalin ever did. Some are killed, all are dehumanized. \\n As a little sci fi adventure, the book isn't terrible. It's really the pretension that goes along with it. Lowry cobbles together religious symbolism and Dystopic tropes and then tries to present it as something as complex and thoughtful as the authors she copied. Copying isn't a crime, but copying poorly is. \\n Like Dan Brown or Michael Crichton, she creates a political pamphlet of her own ideals, slaps a pretense of authority on it, and then waits for the money and awards to roll in--and they did. Many people I've discussed this book with have pointed to those awards as the surest sign of this book's eminent worth. \\n Award committees are bureaucratic organizations. Their decisions are based on political machinations. This book is a little piece of Nationalism, and so it was lauded by the political machine that Lowry supports. The left hand helps the right. If awards are the surest sign of worth, then Titanic is a better movie than Citizen Kane. \\n What surprises me is how many of those who brought up the award as their argument were teachers. If a politically-charged administrative committee is the best way to teach children, then why do you take umbrage when the principal tells you that bigger class sizes (and fewer benefits) are fine? Listen to him: doesn't he have award plaques? \\n The other argument is usually that 'kids like it'. I usually respond that kids also like candy, so why not teach that? Some people also get angry at me for analyzing a book written for children: \\n \"Of course it's not a great book, it's for kids! If you want a good book, go read Ulysses!\" \\n I prefer to give children good books rather than pieces of political propaganda (even if they agreed with me). Children can be as skeptical, quick-witted, and thoughtful as adults if you give them the chance, so I see no excuse for feeding them anything less. \\n Kids aren't stupid, they just lack knowledge, and that's a fine distinction. It's easy for adults to take advantage of their naivete, their emotionality, and their sense of worth. Just because it's easier for the teacher doesn't mean it's better for the child. \\n When we show children something that is over-simplified, presenting an idealized, crudely moralizing world, we aren't preparing them for the actual world. If you give a child a meaningless answer to repeat, he will repeat it, but he won't understand why. \\n Why not give the child a book that presents many complex ideas, but no rote answers, and let them make up their own minds? If they don't learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff and form their own opinions early, in a safe, nurturing environment, what chance will they have on their own as adults? \\n In all the discussions and research regarding this book, I have come across very little analysis. It's especially surprising for a book with such a strong following, but there aren't many explanations of why the book is supposed to be useful or important. \\n This lack of argument makes sense from a political standpoint, since there is no reason to analyze the worth of propaganda: its worth is that it agrees with society and indoctrinates readers. Analyzing it would defeat the purpose; political diatribes do not stand up to thoughtful attention. \\n Perhaps someday someone will create a thoughtful, textual analysis of this book that will point out its merits, its structure and its complexity. I've gradually come to doubt it. I never expected when I wrote my original review of this book that it would garner this much attention. \\n I still welcome comments and thoughts, but if your comment looks roughly like this: \\n \"You should read this book again, but this time, like it more. You think you're smart but you aren't. You're mean. Lowry is great. This book won awards and kids like it. It's meant for kids anyways, why would you analyze what its about? I bet you never even read the sequels. Go read 'Moby Dick' because you are full of yourself.\" \\n I've heard that one before. If you do want to comment though, you might check out this article; I find it helps me with presenting my ideas. || ** spoiler alert ** \\n If there are no wrong answers, can we really say that something has any meaning? \\n It is very easy to start an interesting science fiction story. Simply begin with a mystery. Don't explain things to the reader and leave them in a state of wonder. In this way, everything will seem interesting, intriguing, and worth exploring. Tap into the reader's powers of imagination and allow them to make your story interesting in ways you need not imagine, and perhaps cannot create. This is a good plan for starting a science fiction story. Lots of science fiction stories begin in this way. On television, almost all of them do - 'X-Files', 'Lost', 'Battlestar Galactica', 'The 4400', 'The truth is out there.' 'They have a plan.' \\n 'The Giver' starts in this way. In the first few pages as the setting unfolded, I was struck by the parallels to China after the cultural revolution - the bicycles, the uniform-like clothing, the regulated life, the shame based culture, and 'the sameness'. I also thought of China, because I immediately grasped that this had to be a culture which was designed to gently crash its population. There were many clues that the world was heavily overpopulated and the primary goal of the culture so described was to crash the population without descending into society destroying anarchy - the highly regulated birthrate, which was insufficient to sustain the population. To sustain the population, more than 17 out of each 25 females would have to be assigned to be birth mothers, and this clearly wasn't the case. The replacement rate for a society is about 2.3 live births per female (maybe 2.1 in a society that is safe and careful) - clearly they were implied to be below this ratio so clearly this was a society that was trying to shed population. \\n Equally clearly, this was a society that engaged in widespread euthanasia for the most trivial of causes, which hints at a culture which doesn't value life because people are in such abundance that they can be readily disposed of. I suspected that 'Release' was euthanasia almost immediately from the context in which it was introduced, and this was almost immediately confirmed when it was revealed that infants were subject to 'release'. Clearly, infants can't be meaningfully banished, so clearly release was euthanasia. So I was intrigued by the story. I wanted to see what happened to Jonas and his naive family who had so poised themselves on the edge of a great family wrecking tragedy in just the first few dozen pages of the story. I wanted to receive from the storyteller answers to the questions that the story was poising, if not some great profound message then at least some story that followed from what she began. \\n But it was not to be. The first clue that the whole construct was to eventually come crashing down was that Jonas clearly didn't understand 'release' to mean 'euthanasia'. Nor in fact did anyone seem to know what 'release' meant. This shocked me, because in the context of the setting it was virtually impossible that he and everyone else did not know. I could very easily imagine a stable society where human life was not prized - after all, societies that believe that human life is intrinsically valuable are historically far less common than ones that don't. We know that the society is life affirming, both because we are told how pained and shocked they are by loss and by the fact that Jonas responds to scenes of death with pity and anger. What I could not believe in was a society which held the concept of 'precision of language' so tightly and so centrally that the protagonist could not imagine lying could in fact be founded on lies. That's impossible. No society like that can long endure. Some technological explanation would be required to explain how the society managed to hide the truth from itself. If release took place in some conscious state of mind, then surely the dispensers of Justice, the Nurturers, the Caregivers, and the sanitation workers would all know the lie, and all suspect - as Jonas did - that they were being lied to as well. Surely all of these would suspect what their own future release would actually entail, and surely at least some of them would reject it. Surely some not inconsequential number of new children, reared to value precision of language and to affirm the value of life, would rebel at the audacity of the lie if nothing else. Even in a society that knew nothing of love, even if only the society had as much feeling as the members of the family displayed, and even if people only valued others as much as the Community was shown to value others, surely some level of attachment would exist between people. Soma or not, the seeds of pain, tragedy, conflict and rebellion are present if ever the truth is known to anyone. \\n Nothing about the story makes any sense. None of it bears any amount of scrutiny at all. The more seriously you consider it, the more stupid and illogical the whole thing becomes. We are given to believe that the society has no conception of warfare, to the point that it cannot recognize a child's war game for what it is, and yet we are also given to believe that they train pilots in flying what is implied to be a fighter craft and that the community maintains anti-aircraft weapons on a state of high alert such that they could shoot down such a fighter craft on a moments notice. We are given to believe that all wild animals are unknown to the community, yet we are also given to believe that potential pest species like squirrels and birds are not in fact extinct. How do you possibly keep them out of the community if they exist in any numbers elsewhere? We are given to believe that technology exists sufficient to fill in the oceans and control the weather and replace the natural biosphere with something capable of sustaining humanity, but that technological innovation continues in primitive culture. We are given to believe that they are worried about overpopulation and starvation, and yet also that most of the world is empty and uninhabited or that this inherently xenophobic community lives in isolation if in fact it doesn't span the whole of the Earth. We are given to believe that this is a fully industrial society, yet the community at most has a few thousands of people. Surely thousands of such communities must exist to maintain an aerospace industry, to say nothing of weather controllers. Why is no thought given to the hundreds of other Receivers of Memory which must exist in their own small circles of communities in the larger Community? Surely any plan which ignores the small communities place in the larger is foredoomed to failure? Surely the Receiver of Memory knows what a purge or a pogrom is? \\n How are we to believe that Jonas's father, whose compassion for little Gabriel is so great that he risks breaking the rules for his sake, whose compassion for little Gabriel is so great that he risks face by going to the committee to plead for Gabriel's life, whose compassion for little Gabriel is so great that he discomforts himself and his whole family for a year for the sake of the child, is the same man who so easily abandons that same child at a single setback when he has witnessed the child grow and prosper? Doesn't it seem far easier to believe that this same man, who is openly scornful of the skills and nurturing ability of the night crew, would more readily blame the night crew for Gabriel's discomfort? I can only conclude, just as I can only conclude about the illogical fact that no one knows what release is, that everything is plastic within the dictates of the plot. Jonas's father feels and acts one way when the needs of the plot require it and feels and acts in different ways when the needs of the plot require something else. What I can't believe is that this is any sort of whole and internally consistent character or setting. Every single thing when held up to the light falls apart. There is not one page which is even as substantial as tissue paper. \\n It is almost impossible to draw meaning from nonsense, so it is no wonder that people have wondered at the ending. What happens? The great virtue of the story as far as modern educators are probably concerned is that there are no wrong answers. What ever you wish to imagine is true is every bit as good of answer as any other. Perhaps he lives. Perhaps he finds a community which lives in the old ways, knowing choice - and war and conflict (which probably explains why the community needs anti-aircraft defenses). But more likely from the context he dies. Perhaps he is delusional. Perhaps he gets to the bottom and lies down in the deepening snow which the runners can no longer be pushed through and he dies. Perhaps he dies and goes to heaven, maybe even the heaven of the one whose birthday is celebrated by the implied Holiday. Perhaps it is even the case that he was sent to his death by the cynical Giver, who knew his death was necessary to release the memories he contained by to the community. Perhaps he didn't just die, but was slaughtered as the sacrificial lamb - killed by a murderous lie from the one he trusted too well. For my entry in the meaningless answers contest, I propose that the whole thing was just a dream. This seems the easiest way to explain the contradictions. A dream doesn't have to make sense. And the biggest clue that it is a dream is of course that Jonas sees the world in black and white, with only the occasional flashes of recognized color around important colorful things as is typical of that sort of black and white dream. Perhaps Jonas will wake up and engage in dream sharing with his family, and they will laugh at the silliness and then go to the ceremony of twelves. Or perhaps the whole community is only a dream, and Jonas will wake up and go downstairs and open his Christmas presents with his family. || Woah, I can easily understand why such a grand amount of people loved this book and definitely see why many were not satisfied with the movie. I cannot believe how many elements of this story they changed. However, there is something that I must admit: I preferred the movie because of how melancholic and hopeful it made me feel and for the suspense inside it that the book irrevocably lacked. It is not something that I hear myself say often at all. I have always been that little full of criticism girl who could not help but compare books to movies and movies to books. Quite a negative experience I tend to have with the latter. I mean, Red Riding Hood (trailer), starring Amanda Seyfried, was enticing! Reading the film-to-novel adaptation though felt like walking through mud - tiring, boring, and endless. Why I granted it a three star rating is beyond me. \\n Let's just put that aside though. After all, it is of The Giver that I shall talk about and my time spent reading the story was definitely not wasted - hence the four star rating - even if not what I anticipated. First, the hero was very young, a detail that I seemed to have forgotten before starting this read. Not a problem though, for Jonas showed an impressive and admirable maturity in his character. Even I, at twelve, and others around me at that time, were not as reflective, wise and...intelligent. Sure, math held no secrets from me, but I was not actually resolving problems for the greater good or aware of the true face of the world. As opposite as the situation and context definitely were, the fact remains that Jonas lead this story with greatness and, along the way, opened my eyes to some beautiful themes. \\n It shook me to witness how unimportant Fiona appeared and how no chemistry was palpable between Jonas and her. Apparently, they were friends through Ashen mostly, or at least that is what I deducted. Of course, they volunteered together but it is not as if they talked and shared moments like true friends normally do. Plus, we could barely see her because of how her presence was omitted. Ashen was definitely endearing in this while, in the cinematographic adaptation - I apologies for bringing it up again - I growled at him continuously. \\n This was another example of a book with fine simplistic writing. My first one, I believe, was Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe. Then I discovered some others and familiarized myself with this type of writing. I am completely in favour of it since it can bring such a peaceful atmosphere to stories and make the reader easily understand every detail written. However, there is something that I unluckily often stumble upon when this style is present and this was no exception: repetition. But maybe it is easier to distinguish it since everything in the writing is clearer? \\n Even though I brought up an equal - or so it seems - amount of positive and negative elements for The Giver, I must let you know that the negative ones never bothered, annoyed or frustrated me. They were there, and I was aware of them, but never let any of those weaknesses keep me from enjoying my read. Because I did. So much. \\n PS. For a couple of minutes, I thought that I just read one of the first dystopian books ever written, but this list proved me the contrary. || My Reaction After Reading This: \\n 2 stars \\n Whoa? \\n Why? \\n Really? \\n SO FIRST OFF I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I REALLY REALLY REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS BOOK SINCE MANY HUMAN BEINGS READ AND LOVE THIS BOOK AND MANY HAVE CONSIDERED THIS AS ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL TIME AND BEFORE I POSTED MY RATING I BROWSE THE RATINGS OF OTHER GR MEMBERS SO THAT I KNOW THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY ABNORMAL HUMAN BEING WHO DOESN'T THINK THAT THIS BOOK IS GOOD OR GREAT OR WHATEVER!!! \\n (*coughs* sorry I forgot to turn off the CAPSLOCK, I'm not shouting or anything *coughs* just please don't judge me *coughs* if you like the book, I respect you for that, but I really can't force myself into believing I like this book _(&gt;.&lt;)V) \\n Okay I'll try to explain what I don't like about it: \\n 1. The book is boring. \\n 2. The book is weird. \\n 3. I don't feel any emotions at all towards the character. \\n 4. I don't really understand the book. \\n 5. I don't really understand the ending. \\n 6. I don't really understand why this Utopia world should have no colors, no feelings and no music so that the people would live *coughs* decently. \\n 7. I don't really understand why the children at age whatever should be given ribbons, what's the purpose of that? \\n 8. I don't really understand why the characters should tell about their dreams to their parents. \\n 9. I don't understand why Johnas has to take medications because he was having Stirrings. So stirrings for those who haven't read the book is somewhat closer to wet dreams. \\n 10. I don't understand why the memories of war, loss etc. would make someone want to end his/her life or give up on life. I know that life is imperfect but it seems that the characters have no backbone, like idk I don't buy the logic of that one. \\n 11. In short I don't really understand this at all! \\n If you're wondering whether I've read this one because it's a school requirement, the answer is NO. I buy this book because I've seen it on the list of best YA book here on Goodreads so many times. And if these book is bombarded with symbolism then please explain this to me(since I don't have brains for symbolism PEOPLE!), especially the ending (What the Fudge is that?) and I might change my rating, I repeat might. || I Loved it, I remember reading it on the beach :D, Major worldbuilding, a chilling and exciting story line, a very interesting dystopian novel. \\n In this book everyone is identical, choices are very limited. Every aspect of life is controlled and decided by elders of the community, everyone is content simply because they don't know any different, but Jonas (the hero) is different, he sees things no one else can see. \\n \"Jonas's world is perfect. Everything is under control. There is no war or fear or pain. There are no choices. Every person is assigned a role in the Community. When Jonas turns twelve, he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver. The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life. Now, it is time for Jonas to receive the truth. There is no turning back.\" \\n Jonas is chosen to be the next \"Receiver\", The giver is the only man in the community who holds memories like color, sun, pain, war, courage, happiness, Love, emotions because the people can't handle them and in case they needed guidance, Jonas slowly receives memories from the giver, Through his training, he discovers secrets of the time before theirs, and discovers that the Community is not as perfect as it seems. \\n \"The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.\" || (3.5) Not really surprising but turns out this is more enjoyable when you actually understand English! || The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared. \\n Wow... just wow. \\n I'm really ashamed that I haven't picked up this book sooner. I went on a vacation today, and I spent more than 10 hours in the bus, so I brought few short books to kill the time and this book was one of them. If it wasn't for this trip, who knows when I would pick it up. \\n I devoured every single page of this book so fast, and in the end I was left wanting more. But I do have to say that I'm not sure if I will read the sequels, because I think that this was the perfect way to end this book. \\n Amazing book and I'm sure I'll be re-reading it in the future many, many times. || I believe I would have liked this more if I had read it when I was younger, but who actually reads when they are younger. It needed something more and I will never understand how The Giver could have explained every great feeling that existed in the past without describing sex. I don't necessarily need sex in a book or on a first date, but at least the possibility should be there. || hl lTmtk hdhh lHy@? \\n hl tsh`r blt`b wlnhk? \\n hl khsrt mn lHrwb wlSr`t wlsys@ jml mfy nfsk wfy Hytk? \\n hl Hlmt bdrs@ mjl m`yn wmn`tk `lmtk ldrsy@ mn kml Tryqk fyh? w HSlt `l~ shhd@ wl t`ml bh? w HSlt `l~ shhd@ ljl lshhd@ wlknh fy mjl l ytnsb m` htmmtk? \\n hl ttHTm Hlmk lwHd@ tlw lkhr~ `nd `tbt lwq`? \\n hl ktfyt mn llyly lty qDyth bkyan `l~ wj` ? \\n hl ktfyt mn hlt llm lty tHyT bk wbkl mn tHb? \\n hl tryd ltkhlS mn kl hdh? \\n ldyn lHl....snkhlq lk mjtm` khly mn l'lm, mn lHrwb, mn ljw`, mn lkrh, mn lHsd wlHqd, mn kl shy' slby ymkn n nHqq lk kl Hlmk...ymkn n n`rf mn khll mrqbtk mn wl ywm lwldtk Ht~ l`mr lmnsb lltkhSS fy mjl m`yn....ymkn n n`rf htmmtk wqdrtk `l~ l`T fy mjl m...wtjhyzk Twl Hytk ltkhdm lmjtm` fy hdh lmjl....khy'f l tstTy` lzwj ? snw'hlk lkl hdh...wsnkhtr lk jml wnsb zwj@ tnsbk...khy'f mn mknyt lzwj? khy'f n tkwn shqtk ql mn shqq lGyr? l tqlq fljmy` yHSl `l~ nfs lshq@. nfs lbyt nfs ldykwr nfs lfrsh \\n ljmy` yrtdy nfs lthyb, ljmy` mtswy...khy'f mn khtlf `rq? mn khtlf dyn? mn khtlf fkr? l tqlq snlGy kl hdh... \\n khy'f mn ljw`? mn l`Tsh? khy'f mn lwHd@? mn lmrD? khy'f mn ljry'm wlsrqt wlqtl? khy'f mn lt`rD ll`nf? khy'f n tfshl fy lSr`t fy kl shy' fy lHy@? \\n l tqlq ln t`ysh kl hdh b`d ln \\n wlkn lnstTy` f`l dhlk yjb `lyn n nDHy bb`D lmwr....`lyn n nDHy blfrwq...`lyn n n`ysh fy tmthl tm wtswy mTlq....`lyn n njrdk mn lkhtyr...Ht~ l tkhtr bshkl khTy', `lyn n njrdk mn lmsh`r, Ht~ l t`dhbk, `lyn n njrdk mn lHb, lmwsyq~, llwn, lkhtyr, mn kl shy' ymkn n yj`lk mkhtlf `n y frd mn frd mjtm`k ljdyd. \\n `lyk n tDHy lt`ysh fy s`d@ mstmr@? m mllt mn l'lm? lmdh `lyk n tkhtbr l'lm?

The story is okay, the message (we are all entitled to have choices, don't let anybody else think for yourself, blah blah blah) is okay, the characters are all transparent (yes, even the Giver himself) and I can't help but think that such a theme was tackled before (Animal Farm, Anthem or Fahrenheit 451 come to mind; even City of Ember to some extent, although it was written way after The Giver) and in a much better and satisfying way. The ending is a bit of a letdown but, failing to care for the main character, I wasn't too bugged by it either. So there you have it. || This wonderful novel will at times make you feel sad, sick and desperate, but you will find hope again and cherish what we have in life: love and happiness along with pain, and friends and family along with the bullies and enemies. Unlike the people in the Giver, we can see all the colors and hear all the sounds even those we don't like. It's all because we have freedom to choose (most of the time). \\n The ending left me baffled though. I know the author wanted it open ended. She then got bombarded with children's letters over the years so she reluctantly wrote the sequels, which clarified it. \\n Still, a clear five-star book. Enjoy! || Being a student at the time, The Giver didn't seem to 'hit the spot' so to speak. As a 16 year old teen, it's funny to say \"I live to read, read to live\" but it's true. Let's just say I wouldn't live to read The Giver. || Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ \\n What would you give to live in a perfect world? \"A life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.\" What if all your needs were taken care of and you were guaranteed shelter, employment, food, clothing, etc.? What if that world protected you from ever making a wrong choice? What if those choices were things like choosing your own spouse, your own job, how many children to have, if you were allowed to have children at all? What if those choices made words like \"love\" obsolete? You see, \"love\" is such a generic term that it shouldn't be used in conversation. Do you really \"love\" your child? Wouldn't you rather pinpoint characteristics you find admirable rather than using such a broad term? Wouldn't that be safer? \\n One of the most profound books I've read this year. When I started The Giver I felt, almost immediately, that it should be required reading. I wasn't surprised to hear that a different Lowry book (Number the Stars) had been assigned to my son's middle-school class. At just the right length, and a pace that keeps everything flowing, The Giver is filled with \"A-Ha Moments\" and the all-important moral that \"it's the choosing that's important, isn't it?\" || Jonas grows up in a community where everybody and everything are the same. The people do not have choices, everything is chosen for them. It is known in the community that once a child turns twelve, they are assigned to a job which they must start training for. \\n Once Jonas turns twelve he is assigned the position of the Receiver of Memories, the person who the Giver, the keeper of memories, gives memories of the past. But Jonas will struggle with many of the memories that he receives such as pain, starvation, pollution and war. Jonas will learn the secrets and sacrifices that were made to create his perfect community. He like the Receivers before him must decide if he can bare the tremendous responsibilities of being the next Giver. And if he can't he feels he must find a way to escape the community. \\n This is not a book I would normally read, but in saying that I thought it was a good read and quite entertaining. This is a book which I'm sure many have enjoyed and will continue to enjoy. || Reading The Giver right after finishing Williams' Stoner was a mistake. Now that I'm done with it, I feel like I had just completed a satisfying meal complimented by a delicious dessert, only to reach for a glass, take a sip, and find out it has sea water in it. My palate is ruined. \\n I must admit that, before writing this review, I looked at some of the reviews posted on Goodreads. I also must admit that either my literary tastes have been spoiled by past quality offerings, or that most of the [over one million] people who rated this book have no idea what quality fiction is. Whatever the real case might be, I feel sad. \\n Where should I begin? Oh yes, at the beginning. The Giver lacks originality. Those who read widely will probably find elements from other books and stories, done and overdone ad nauseum. \\n The premise of The Giver vaguely resembles the ideas put forth by Plato about 2500 years ago in his The Republic. The idea of a society where predetermined ideas replace choices for the greater benefit of an unknowing populace has also been explored in many utopian and dystopian books alike. Unlike the original proponents of such ideas, The Giver does not have a clear path to follow, as it dabbles in both utopia and dystopia without any clear direction. The entire book is composed of a fabric so full of holes, that an alert reader simply cannot take the information presented for granted. \\n Instance after instance, the reader is offered a 'fact' which contradicts reason, yet the author either does not consider the reader intelligent enough to see this, or valuable enough to bother with an explanation. Simply put, the author asks the reader to suspend disbelief without providing the necessary path for this to occur. To me, this is both insulting and a sign of laziness. \\n Let's assume, for a moment, that I was writing a novel, which takes place in a world where everyone walks. Suddenly, the protagonist takes off flying. As an author, I would have to create a backstory, a believable explanation why the protagonist has ability unique to him. Lowry, however, does not bother with explanations. Acts are presented as a matter of fact, despite their pertinence to the advancement of the plot, and there is no justification. \\n The plot itself, if it can be called that, is rather shallow at best. Imagine, for a moment, a society where feelings are superficial, emotions are unnecessary, and a ruling body makes choices for the populace, which is unaware of the lack of reality, that ensure the smooth continuation of the utopia. Then, out of the blue, a boy with a power to see beyond (unexplained) is told that he was selected to carry the pain of memories for the entire community (again, no explanation why the regular citizens do not have memories, emotions, et cetera). The boy begins to receive memories, both painful and joyful, and mentions to his teacher that it would be better if all citizens had memories. The teacher agrees, but reasons that he has thought the same for ages, and could not find a way for it to happen. The teacher recalls an incident where an earlier apprentice quit and the memories transmitted to her escaped and entered the citizens. Suddenly, he and the boy realize that this is the way to enable the citizens to have memories, and they hatch a plan for the boy to escape the community so that, once he leaves, the memories he has will return and enter the population. Wow. Really? Ahem . . . boring. There are so many holes in this, and the author does not bother with any explanations. How are the memories contained within only one individual? How do the memories leave that individual and enter the population? How come the memories cannot leave the physical boundaries of the community but the individual can? Why does the 'giver' not leave himself do accomplish this? Why did it take him ages to figure this out? How come no one has done it before? \\n Okay, what am I, an idiot? \\n Thus, as a utopian/dystopian tale, this fails. \\n Some, however, view this as a coming of age story, since Jonas (the protagonist) has an awakening and finds his consciousness. Again, I cannot view this work seriously as a coming of age story, because the awakening is mediocre at best, and the required character arc is lacking. Jonas might have had an awakening, but it was nothing groundbreaking. It was more like: Oh, I have a power. Oh, I'm learning things. Hey, my father has been lying to me! Okay, this should stop. I'm outta here before they kill the baby, which recently entered my life. \\n The story had the potential to explore the disenchanted nature of the protagonist, the buildup and the excitement of discovering the truth, only to have the weight of the truth crush him. It had the potential to explore inner turmoil, the will to rise against injustice, deception, and the wrong rule. But it did not. It presented the tale in an arc that was rather flat. \\n The plot and characters aside, I found the writing somewhat dull. It lacked on many levels. \\n In conclusion, I must admit that I am, perhaps, more critical in my review than necessary. Nevertheless, in light of the countless glowing reviews posted on Goodreads by English Majors, educators, and readers, I feel it is my duty to be critical. When numerous books of higher literary merit are overlooked and virtually unknown, a book awarded the Newbery Medal should live up to the standards associated with that prestigious award. Looking back at it, I do not see why it was awarded. || 4.5/5 \\n This book was so good! I really enjoyed the premise of the book and how simple things, like color, were foreign to the people in this community. The ending was completely open-ended and I wish we got to know more about what happened. \\n I couldn't give it a 5/5 because I was a little bored after Jonas was given the assignment of the Receiver, but it was still a great read. || Reread this for the class im teaching. Loved it this time around as well. however, having read the Hunger Games series and then The Giver back to back, I find myself rather aware of the fact that the dominant race in these societies is, well, white. And the whole \"pale eyes\"=special thing in the Given has always rubbed me the wrong way (consider readers of color and consider how often this trope of \"pale eyes\" or \"blue eyes\"= special is used in YA literature, and the problem is obvious.). At least that's how it came across to me. I need to marinate on this. My issue is not with the books themselves, it's with the collective and lack of diversity within the collective. In other words, the usual problem. || The is, for me at least, the definitive in distopic literature. It's the measure to which I hold most other mg/ya sci fi. || Honestly I don't think I can write a full review for it. All in all it was good and it'd be amazing if I was 12-14 and reading dystopia for the first time. \\n Looking forward to the movie, though. || Do posledno se kolebakh kakvo tochno da napisha za \"Paziteliat\", zashchoto mnenieto mi za knigata e malko protivorechivo. \\n Naistina kharesakh osnovnata ideia na romana - antiutopichniiat sviat beshe dobre izgraden i imakh iasna kartina za zhivota na khorata v nego, miastoto na vseki edin ot tiakh, lishavaneto im ot svobodata na izbor, striktnite pravila i zabrani, koito triabvashe da spazvat...

Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem.

Couldn't even take notes. Watched the movie immediately after finishing. Need next book. Wish I lived in this world. Damn you, Rowling. || Buddy-read with two of my Great Escape gal pals- Stepheny and Ivonne. \\n Be on the look out for Stepheny Potthead aka The Book Pusher aka Quick Draw Stepheny aka The Nutty Professor. Last seen running along side the Knight Bus with Harry Potter's invisible cloak. Also Suspected in the kidnapping of fellow Goodreader Jeff and best-selling author Stephen King. Blonde Hair...big green doll eyes, has a frightening maniacal cackle and a tendency to whine when she doesn't get her way. LOUDLY. Considered armed and dangerous- approach with caution...and Nerds- she likes Nerds. \\n Now back to our regularly scheduled review.... \\n I don't listen to a lot of audio-books (I prefer to read) but I was kind of falling behind in my reading commitments...and I had put Ms. Stepheny off again and again for this buddy-read soooooo many times- I couldn't do it again to her (she pouts..and she gets all mopey and it is JUST heartbreaking). I am so happy I listened to this one- Stephen Fry was just perfect. Perfect!..and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was just the thing to put me in the Christmas Spirit. \\n It's Harry's least favorite time of year- school break spent with the Dursleys...and this visit isn't going well. First: News that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban- Second: An unfortunate accident involving mean Aunt Marge... \\n Harry decides not to stick around- and catches the Knight Bus to Diagon Alley- where instead of getting in trouble for using magic away from Hogwarts, he gets invited to stay until school begins, by Cornelius Fudge-the Minister for Magic. \\n The night before he is expected to leave- Harry is warned that Sirius may have escaped with murder in mind- and HE may be the target.... \\n This is my favorite of the series so far!! I loved that it was still light and fun...but that the darkness is slooooooooowly creeping in. \\n I loved that a lot of it took place during the Christmas Holidays... \\n I really liked the addition of the Dementors...spoooooky... \\n ...and I adored Buckbeak!! \\n As for the whereabouts of Stepheny? I can almost guarantee...she is up to no good. || Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home. \\n *I was feeling guilty okay?Seeing this in my currently reading shelf while in reality it was in standby mode. * \\n And there are Moony,Padfoot,Prongs and Wormtail (Sexy names) in Prisoner of Azkaban....So, the welcome home thing gets even better. \\n --Since my reading slump won't let me read or sleep ,I might as well try to knock some sense into mudblood people who still haven't picked up the perfection that is Harry Potter. Hey don't look at me accusing loathsome eyes, I'm not a racist just Slytherin. I'm supposed to say mean things like that.&lt;&lt; Gotta keep the stereotype and all. \\n So lets talk about HOW your unassuming life will change if you read this magical series; \\n De-friending not so innocent bystanders announcing \"Harry Potter is dumb\" or \"Harry Potter is for kids\" will become a common occurrence. Ask any potterhead, it happens a lot of times. \\n What is your Hogwarts house will become your idea of small talk. \\n You'll start saying Harry Potter cliches like\"I'm still waiting for my Hogwart's letter\", (probably) make random curse references (accio remote) and maybe start saying things like she is such a fake Harry Potter fan when someone doesn't know that Owlpost is the first chapter of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. \\n Umm you'll make a lot of new friends starting this way. \\n or maybe kicked out of class for calling a teacher Muggle who will unfortunately understand the reference, get offended and ban you from his class. I bet he was a Gryfinndor. \\n You''ll probably have a shrine of a lot of Harry Potter goodies. \\n Then try to convert the remaining unassuming people into Harry Potter fans. \\n Or become obsessive and say Harry Potter 50 times a day and get a award for reiteration.*thank you all* \\n P.S RIP Alan Rickman. We'll always remember your always and oily hair. \\n P.P.S OOO and even if you hate Malfoy in the books you'll have a---Lets call it a crush,for want of a better word. ON HIM. (Really) \\n And I'm not kidding with the next spoiler. It's anything but fake. || The third HP adventure serves to bring the likable Sirius Black into the story and get Gryffindor their Quidditch Cup, but the story and action was still far less gripping than the first novel. I thought that Lupin was an interesting character, but less spectacular than the previous two teachers against the Black Arts. I recall reading this for the first time nearly two decades ago when it came out and losing enthusiasm for the Harry Potter universe. However, I read it again so that I can read the rest with my son (he refused to read 2 and 3 with me because he felt they were the weakest books in the series and I have to say I agree with him). Nonetheless, one must read this story for the long game if one wishes to make sense of the rest. I am still a bit baffled by the whole switcheroo that Prang &amp; Co did leading to the death of HP's father and mother, but perhaps they will return to that later. \\n On to The Goblet of Fire and the Quidditch World Cup! ||  || \"OMG -- Not another book review on Harry Potter.\" *or* \"OMG -- I LOVE HARRY POTTER\" \\n I bet you just said something along those lines... Me too. But I have to do this for two reasons: (1) It's Harry Potter and (2) I committed to writing a real review for every book I've read and I'm only on 202 of 454. Slap me please. But when I'm done, not quite yet. \\n However, to save us both... I won't do a review on this whole book. You can read every other review for that! I'll just say the top 5 reasons why I loved this particular book: \\n 1. Harry Potter went dark! Not the book... the character... this was the first time for me where I really stood back and said \"He's growing up. He's realizing not everything around him should be believed without a hint of doubt.\" When he protected Sirius in the Shrieking Shack, it all changed for me. \\n 2. Dementors are awesome. I love the concept of stealing someone's soul through sucking their physical body off its bones. \\n 3. Transfiguration is a focus point, and I love seeing people turn into animals. It's like our core is bursting to show itself. \\n 4. Remus was my favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He was someone I'd want to hang out with... you know, and be a werewolf and all. \\n 5. History is revealed in many family connections and secrets. And since that's my favorite thing... this book was the most eye-opening for me. \\n See, that wasn't so bad to re-read a little bit of Harry Potter. I promise the next one won't be so hard. Only 4 left to write a review for. \\n About Me \\n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find TV &amp; Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world.

Thanks for stopping by. \\n [polldaddy poll=9729544] \\n [polldaddy poll=9719251] || I read this as a buddy read, but really I wanted to compare the text to the movies more than anything. I've watched them so much and I've only read the series once through. (Now twice through this third book.) \\n So what do I think about this monstrosity of a series that gets so many hearts a-pumpin? About this book in particular? \\n I love it. \\n But how about this book in comparison to the film, you ask? \\n ALAS! I like the movie better. \\n What??? Blasphemy! Heretic! \\n No no no, give me a chance. I liked the fact that Hermione develops real stressed-out reasons for giving up the time-turner even if the reasons are still rather weak, all told, when taken in conjunction with all the other crap that happens in the series later. It'll always be one of those hedge-moments for me. BUT, putting that aside, the actual narrative events that happen in the book that I think are the best parts, namely the space of a certain 3 hour stretch, BOTH times, was much more fascinating and fleshed out in the movie. \\n Sorry! It's true! All the expressions and the little tidbits and quirks were more brilliant on the screen. And so was the penultimate event that always... ALWAYS brings tears to my eyes... the moment when Harry realizes that he was the one to bring out that awesome power to save himself. Even now I tear up when I think about it. \\n Yes, the book has it, but the build up was just too quick in the text. The movie, however, did what movies are brilliant at.... SHOWING us the enormity of the event. Sometimes it just takes the right media. \\n The movie is my favorite of the series. I'm reserving judgement as to whether the book is as well. (At least until I finish my re-read. :) || Is there any way to write a review on any of the Harry Potter books without doing it injustice? Nearly nobody attempts to create a full review on this series because of 1) its popularity, 2) its huge fanbase and 3) its awesomeness in general. And neither will I do so. The first book was fantastic, although I read it probably ten years too late in my life. The second book was not so fantastic, but still a great book. And the third one ... completely blew my mind. \\n I wanted to write a review on this book; I even started a checklist to keep track of what I wanted to add here. But the further I delved into the stories about the Prisoner of Azkaban, the more did I realize that the only things I was going to say were 'X is awesome', 'Y rocks' and 'Z simply has to be the winner'. The only aspect which might be criticized about this book might be the fact that some characters like Voldemort, Malfoy or, on the other hand, Harry, Hermione or Ron are relatively black or white, evil or good. But I don't mind. Because. Those. Characters. Are. Amazing. Hagrid and Lupin are my new favorites after reading this book. And I want more of Hedwig, because - owls! \\n In contrast to the two previous books, the pace is so wonderfully matching in this book. Just at the right time before the descriptions of the Hogwarts school year (all of them contributing to the entire plot) might turn too extensive, the story climbs up to its climax and concludes within one hundred pages of incredible tension. Logical relevations, long-desired confrontations and a lot of surprises will accompany you during your journey with Harry and his friends, resulting in the convergence of several different plotlines which were established during the course of the novel. \\n Most of the people I know have read this book, but if you happen to be one of the few exceptions, then go read it. Maybe you fear it because of its fantasy elements? I've never been a fan of fantasy either, but this book series changed my opinion. Maybe you fear it because of its popularity? Don't be afraid. The hype is completely justified. \\n My reviews in the Harry Potter series: \\n 1) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: Go to review \\n 2) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: Go to review || Shit got real! \\n For me, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was when the series got exciting! It certainly got darker and more mature. Torture, loss, a foreboding sense of dread and death itself descended upon this happy little world of magic where school exams and difficult professors were the worst things to worry about until recently. \\n I'm a big fan of the tone. The series jumps right into its bigboy pants here. As an adult reading these books, I was glad to see the maturity. Yeah, it's still YA and not targeted towards me, but at least now it felt a little closer to something in my old man range. \\n As mentioned before, there's an ever present element of death in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Those ghoulish dementors are death itself. However, it also introduced a reason for Harry to want to live: his godfather, a connection to his parents. Up until then there was little joy in Harry's life. Sure there was the school, but that would end soon enough. Rowling did a smart thing when she introduced Sirius Black, she gave Harry a human bond and something to lose. As readers our attachment grew with his. That was when Harry became real to me. || Re-read 2015 - 5 always magical stars \\n Let's not talk about how Sirius kept his sanity (most of it anyway) in Azkaban to avenge his best friends. \\n Or how he asked Harry to stay with him for the summer \\n And the thing that happened in the later books... \\n Let's not... || 5 STARS!!! \\n My Favorite book and movie in the HP series!! I loved diving back into this world and reading about Sirius and Remus again and how dark this one was.

None of us have read or finished the Harry Potter series, and as teachers it is about time we read one of the most popular YA book series. \\n This book starts off like the other two Harry Potter books. Harry is at his Aunt and Uncle's place and gets rescued from their evil ways and makes his way to the wizarding world. This book has a similar pattern to the other books. Harry is involved in Quidditch and in every game he faces challenges from the outside. He also has a villain in this book that is not Lord V. Black is a murderer escaped from Azkaban and is being pursued by the soul-sucking Dementors who guarded him in prison. \\n Harry faces multiple challenges and problems and overcomes them with greatness. These books are decently predictable, but J.K.

The cast of characters and world really expanded in this one and there were some moments of brilliance. My one complaint was the pacing, as something great would happen and then there'd be long stretches of time without much plot development. I still don't feel like I'm aboard the HP fandom train but I think I might be getting there. Also psyched I finally know what the Marauders Map is. || Yep, still my favourite.</td>\n",

So I forced him to read my favorite \"kid book\" and guess what happened????? \\n He started flagging quotes just like his nutcase mother . . . \\n Know what else? It really kind of kicks all the butt to have \"book club\" with a small human. We'd read 20 pages a day (the required amount - unfortunately I'm not a miracle worker so he still doesn't loooooooooove the process of reading like I do) and then drink hot cocoa and talk about what we read (to confirm he really was reading this time and not pretending). Sometimes we would share tears and sometimes we would share laughs.

Every kid should read this and we should read books like this in class instead of the boring stuff they make us read.\" \\n My reaction????? \\n This book will break your heart . . . but then it will put the pieces back together again. Filled with lessons of being a decent person that it teaches in the best, most non-preachy way possible. Bottom line is it is just . . . \\n Have you seen Hot Rod? It's kind of the worst movie ever while simultaneously being the best movie ever. My kid is a freaky movie quoter like his mother and encouraged me to overshare this gif. If you read the book you'll see it makes sense. What are you waiting for? Go read it right now. Here, I'll even help you with the supplies you'll need before starting . . . \\n I bought a hardback of this book because it is seriously one of the best things I've ever read. I look forward to forcing my future grandchildren to experience all of its Wonder just like I did to their daddy. || Really great story about bullying and what it's like to be different in the mean world of middle school. My only issue is there wasn't much of a plot and I found it slow at times but I think that may be because it's middle grade. I guess I just would've liked a more cohesive story line. || I'm not kidding when I say every single person from 10 years to adults should read this book. The blurb made it sound special, but how special I had no idea. I can tell you now it is one of the most special stories I have ever read. \\n August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a genetic defect that changed his face. He and his family are perfectly aware of the attention he attracts, and the decision to send him to 'outside school' for the first time in Grade 5 was not taken lightly. This is the story of Auggie's life through middle school, and it is an unbelievably inspiring, life-changing journey. \\n The narrative is told from different points of view, which makes the story more real for all kinds of readers. Not everyone sees Auggie in the same light, and each has their own way of coming to understand and love him. Via has been through a lot as August's elder sister, and though she's one of the most generous, loving sisters ever, the pressures of high school are taking their toll. But for her brief moments of weakness she more than makes up with a determination to start over that makes this story inspiring and relevant for every teen. Justin, Via's new boyfriend, is an easy-going, down to earth character, yet somehow his simplicity allows him to perceive things at a deeper level than most. I love his thoughts about whether 'the universe' was really unkind to Auggie Pullman, and his conclusion is perfect. That page titled 'The Universe' would make a profound stimulant for discussion. Summer is one of those extraordinary kids who observe with their heart and are not afraid to act. Jack is every kid who has cause to regret a friendship bungle, and who, in the process, learns so much about the kind of person he wants to be. Miranda, Via's old friend, perhaps has it hardest of them all, and her difficulties seem set to ruin her life. Yet she is one of the few who have always seen Auggie as the wonder he truly is, and because of him she finds her way home. \\n Others' points of view are interspersed with Auggie's own, and it's beautiful to see his character grow: what a transformation from the beginning to the end; what a lot he has to go through. Initially he shows us an excusable frustration with his condition and people's reaction to it, and his middle childhood growing pains are so much more acute than those of others. Like Via says, \"My worst day, worst fall, worst headache, worst bruise, worst cramp, worst mean thing anyone could say has always been nothing compared to what August has gone through.\" But more than this, we see the strength of his loving family which nurtures in him the qualities that make him so special: courage, kindness, friendship, character, helping him become someone truly great, someone \"whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.\" Those last few chapters which include Mr Tushman's speech would make another inspiring discussion. \\n Somehow the genuineness of Auggie's situation naturalises all the advice the reader is given. There are references to all of my favourite books: The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, my favourite line from Shakespeare's Hamlet, and one of the most profound quotes from Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and all the quotes are meaningfully connected with the characters. I won't spoil the power they have in the story by relaying them here, you just have to read it. And then there are Mr Browne's 'precepts' which are a kind of motto for his class to follow each month, another great idea that is subtle but so effective, you'll want to memorise the full list at the end. \\n After reading the book I wanted to find out more about the author. Who is the person who can write something like this? What I learned from her blog only made me love the book more. Her last note of thanks went to \"the little girl in front of the ice cream shop and all the other \"Auggies,\" whose stories have inspired me to write this book.\" She said that there were passages where she cried while writing it, and gives a moving account of reading it to her own son. This is a person I would like to know. www.GoodReadingGuide.com \\n \"That's how it is in heaven. It's just love, and no one forgets who they love.\" \\n \"Do people look the same when they go to heaven, mommy?\" \\n \"I don't know. I don't think so.\" \\n \"Then how do people recognize each other?\" \\n \"I don't know, sweetie. They just feel it. You don't need your eyes to love, right?\" \\n \"no, no, it's not all random, if it really was all random, the universe would abandon us completely. and the universe doesn't. it takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. like with parents who adore you blindly. and a big sister who feels guilty for being human over you. and a little gravelly-voiced kid whose friends have left him over you. and even a pink-haired girl who carries your picture in her wallet. maybe it is a lottery, but the universe makes it all even out in the end. the universe takes care of all its birds.\" \\n \"The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.\" \\n \"...your deeds are like your monuments. Built with memories instead of stone.\" || \"Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed.\" \\n This is the kind of story that should be read by everyone, from children to adults because it teaches many valuable lessons, and most importantly it shows us what it's like to be in someone else's shoes. \\n The storyoif Auggie is different because he's simply different, we witness his experience in life and also the experience of the people around him, from family to school mates. So we got to read the story from different POV, the chapters are also very short and keep changing between characters which made this easy and fun to read. \\n This story was packed with so many emotions, I nearly cried at some parts and laughed at others, \\n The writing was beautiful and fun, i finished this so fast and could not put it down, i never got bored and always wanted to have more. I rarely enjoy realistic stories but this one is brilliant and fun. \\n And I will always try to remember to be kinder, because being just kind is not enough. || 4 Stars \\n Overview: \\n \"When given the choice between being right and being kind, choose kind.\" \\n I don't read a lot of middle-grade, but this broached an assortment of complicated topics with more sensitivity than most 'adult' books and really surprised me. \\n The main character, August was born with a facial abnormality that not only resulted in dozens of surgeries, but prevented him from attending school until 5th grade. This story revolves around his first year at his new school. \\n Pros: \\n The narrators range in from 10 year-olds to highschool-students and the voices reflect this. The kids sounded like kids. The teenagers sounded like teenagers. Everyone had a distinct voice that wasn't limited by age. \\n The message here is important. I strongly believe this book would be a great gift for a child around August's age, because it opens all sorts of conversations about empathy. It encourages them to think about the ramifications of their actions and the way they view each other, without being overwhelming or needlessly dark. \\n Via's story was my favorite and I wasn't expecting the switch to her POV, but I'm so glad it was there. It's easy to get wrapped up in August's story and how it affects him daily--but R. J. Palacio doesn't let you forget it's the same for his family. This was a more complicated approach than I expected from this book, and I think it was handled with care. \\n I appreciated that August's classmates were of all different races, socioeconomic backgrounds and religions. \\n August was a very precious and loving kid, and it was incredibly easy to root for him. \\n Cons: \\n Probably because I don't read a lot of middle-grade, I didn't fully connect with this the way someone younger (or more willing to enter that mind-set) might have. This story is very wholesome and upbeat, and looking through cynical-adult glasses, I couldn't help but feel it lost realism because of it. \\n Via's boyfriend has his own POV... told without punctuation or capitalization? It was incredibly frustrating to read and actually made his chapters harder to understand. I couldn't understand why Palacio decided to do this, until I found this quote from her website: \\n \"I remember thinking back then, especially when I would get into the really low notes, that notes on a musical staff looked a little like lowercase letters of the alphabet...Maybe it's because I've been a graphic designer for so many years, but I'm trained to see typefaces and fonts not just as communication devices, but as visual cues for other things. So when it came to writing from Justin's point of view, because he's a musician, someone who thinks in musical terms, it just seemed natural for me to use lowercase letters to represent his thoughts in a very visual way. He's the kind of person who doesn't talk a lot, because he's naturally shy, but has a lot going on inside. The running monologue inside his head has no time for capital letters or punctuation: it's like his thoughts are streaming inside his mind. \\n ...so I understand. But personally, I still didn't like it. I think there were better ways of communicating Justin's character without font-tricks. \\n I'm totally nit-picking here, but why did everyone talk about 5th grade being the first year of middle school? Because where I'm from, middle school is grades six through eight and 5th is still elementary. \\n In Conclusion: \\n A sweet Middle-Grade story that showcases the importance of empathy through a diverse cast of characters and one adorable little boy. || I don't know how to describe this book. It has so much power in it. I think everyone should read it and maybe,just maybe, the world would be a better and kinder place. \\n This is a heart-felt book,so much meaning into it. Its about being different,being kind to the people who are different,its also about family,friendships and its just all the was amazing. I cried so much while reading this BUT i also laughed a lot. Its not a 'omg this is so sad' book,its a 'that's the world,it may be ugly sometimes but its also really really GREAT.' kind of book. I seriously laughed out loud while reading this and i was in public so people thought i was crazy xD \\n I loved so many parts of it,where do i even begin? The POVs were perfection. I loved how each character got a different kind of writing and expressing themselves,because we're ALL different and its beautiful. I also loved how it was so honest. His sister loving him but also sometimes feeling guilty about the way the world or herself was thinking. Jack,trying to figure things out. Auggie being this funny,sarcastic,brave little boy. I just LOVE him afijailf *FEELS* :') And don't even get me started on the Julian chapter. Such a powerful piece. WOW. This book should win all the awards. Seriously. It needs a standing ovation. || \"Some things you just can't explain. You don't even try. You don't know where to start. All your sentences would jumble up like a giant knot if you opened your mouth. Any words you used would come out wrong.\" \\n This is exactly how I feel as I sit here trying to come up with the words to explain this book and how it made me feel. I'm going to give it my best. \\n Kids can be cruel. Kids can be surprisingly empathetic. That's a part of what this book is about. \\n Auggie Pullman was born with a one in a million(s) facial defect. The kind of defect that startles the unsuspecting, the kind of defect that will stop a person dead in their tracks, and at 10 years of age Auggie decides to go to a real school. \\n It was called Junior High in my day and that started in the 7th grade. Today it's called Middle school and it starts in the 5th grade. According to my dusty memory, this time in a kid's life can suck even if you have a normal face, so for Auggie this year has the potential to be much worse. \\n When he was born he was not expected to live, but he did. Through the years of his young life he had many surgeries to make his face functional. He was home schooled until fifth grade when he and his family decided it was time to go to a real school. As you would expect, he had a hard time winning friends.....kids are shallow. But the friends he won early on were keepers, because they went against the stream when they became his friend. \\n The year had many tough moments for Auggie and many great ones. Told by six different voices, telling the story of the year and of Auggie's life, from each of their perspectives, and it was done brilliantly. It could have become confused and messy very easily, but it was spot on. This book is a little, sparkly, gem. \\n \"The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.\" || Everyone seems to love this book all over the place - apparently for very convincing reasons, as it deals with what a deformed little boy has to go through in school when his new classmates are confronted with his face for the first time. This is a book about bullying, but also about hope, friendship and family. And it's a good book, featuring a believable and interesting protagonist you simply can't help but relate to. \\n August ,,Auggie\" Pullman has been born with a cleft palate which left him with a facial deformation, influencing his hearing abilities and scaring a lot of the people he meets away. After being homeschooled for quite some years, at the age of ten, Auggie's parents finally decide to allow him to enter middle school - leading Auggie into the beginning of a new chapter in his life, a chapter in which he is going to be confronted with friendship and the darkest sides of bullying alike. Entering this novel, I didn't know that cleft palates occure in 1 to 2 per 1000 births in the developed world - the subject of the novel is certainly a very strong and important one, a subject people should be confronted with because, after all, there is still too much bullying in this world. \\n Palacio structured her book in a very interesting way by including the viewpoints of several characters. After allowing the reader to get used to Auggie's voice, we meet his sister Via, then one of Auggie's friends at school, Summer, afterwards another classmate called Jack, then Via's boyfriend and finally an old friend of Via, Miranda. All of them were characterized by unique voices ... a method I didn't approve of at all. Why does an author need to write entire chapters without capitalization and in fragmented sentences just to underline that the character doesn't seem to care about grammar and how to express oneself properly? It was annoying and a struggle to read, as were the Facebook chat messages between two characters, which mainly consisted of messages like ,,can we b frenz agen?\" or ,,awsum!!!!\" by characters who talk in their own point of view chapters sophisticated enough to appear capable of using the English language without butchering it. It is simply contradictory when the author writes about one character in his very own punctuation, but then writes inconsistently about the voices of others. \\n If you don't want to be spoiled about the ending, then please don't read the parts I marked as such. Don't say I didn't warn you. \\n The ending is happier than a novel with such a dark and depressing topic should be allowed to be. Reminiscent of successful movies like ,,Shawshank Redemption\", this tale dealt with serious topics and then allowed the topic hope to take over the style of the story. But in comparison with Shawshank, ,,Wonder\" didn't conclude on a bitter-sweet and realistic note, it simply cried out ,,Here is your happy ending!\" and ,,Be happy about it!\" I did care for Auggie and was happy to realize that in the ending he had his own touching and amazing moments. But it took away a lot of the realistic aspects from the beginning, because when does a story actually end on such a happy note in real life? Remember that this is simply my personal opinion, but I thought that a more subtile conclusion would have been more memorable. The way it was written, this simply appeared to be like another school drama, even in spite of all the serious topics which were attached in the beginning and the middle part. \\n Some time after the release of Wonder, R.J. Palacio published another chapter with the point of view of Julian, one of the kids who bullied Auggie in school. Not even Goodreads seems to know how to deal with this story, as there is one edition of Wonder with more than 160,000 ratings (the one I am reviewing right now) and then another edition with 110,000 ratings which includes the ten pages from the Julian chapter. Until a few weeks ago, those two editions were combined in a single book, yet now they have been divided into two different books on GR - which is confusing as hell. (Edit: As of October 2016, the two editions are combined as one single edition again.) Anyway, I gave the other edition two stars because of the way Palacio tried (and for me, obviously, failed) to excuse bullying. Julian was revealed to have suffered from nightmares about scary faces in his childhood, which made him feel like Auggie is just another monster - thus his awful behavior towards him. I don't doubt that something like this might happen in real life, just as, after all, there is no excuse for bullying. It was the way Palacio sounded as if this was to redeem Julian's character which confused me and ultimately made me feel like having some negative experiences in one's childhood makes up for plaguing someone who isn't even responsible for the way he looks. \\n This is a book loved by almost everyone, and they are all right. Believe them. I'm just this weird reader who almost never likes those books which have received all the attention in the universe. \\n Buddy Read with Anne. Click here for her review. || Original post at One More Page \\n There was a time a few years ago when I was hearing mass with my family, and I happened to stand beside this man at church. The man wasn't dressed the way other people were dressed during Sunday mass. He looked scruffy, almost like he came straight from the streets to the church. He didn't look dangerous, and perhaps he even is nice given that he was in church and all. But what I really noticed were his hands. They were, if I were to be perfectly honest, kind of scary. The memory's vague, but I remember that it looked like he had some kind of skin disease -- lesions, wounds and spots -- the kind that one would refuse to touch in fear of contagion. I was afraid to touch it, knowing especially that at a certain part of the mass, I would have to hold his hand while praying The Lord's Prayer. \\n I tried, I really did. I was in church, and holding hands with a stranger during a prayer is the thing to do. It was the good thing, the kind thing, the loving thing. It was expected. I told myself that I would do it, that I would hold his hand during The Lord's Prayer and not be scared or repulsed or look for a hand sanitizer after the prayer. I told myself, I prepared myself and I wanted to do it. \\n But I didn't. When the priest told everyone to \"join hands and as one family pray the prayer Jesus had taught us,\" I chickened out, opened my hand but did not take his, looked ahead and prayed, feeling the guilt grow heavier as the mass went on. \\n This particular memory may seem insignificant and well, I may be blowing things out of proportion. Perhaps the man never even noticed me at all -- but it struck me because I really wanted to do the kind thing, but I didn't because I was afraid. Just like how the other kids and grown ups in the book reacted to Auggie in Wonder by R.J. Palacio. August Pullman was born with a facial deformity that made him quite special to his family for his need of extra care. He has never attended a normal school, until he agreed with his parents to start attending fifth grade at Beecher Prep. Auggie is a perfect fit for the school, except maybe for his face. Told in Auggie's point of view as well as five more from the people around him, we follow Auggie as he faces one of the most challenging times of his young life. \\n I was prepared for a barrage of emotions that Wonder could probably give me, after reading several reviews and updates from Goodreads friends about this book. I knew that I was probably going to like it, but what I wasn't prepared for were what kind of emotions it would bring. Being a middle grade book, the writing was pretty simple and easy to read, especially since most of the narrators were kids as well. Wonder is bound to remind readers of their own middle school (or in my case, late elementary years, since we do not have middle school in the Philippines) experiences. It's strange to think of it, but young people can be very mean, even if it's not on purpose, and Wonder shows how it could be. My heart went out for Auggie, especially since he did not ask to look like the way he does. Like his parents, I wanted the best for him too. \\n The story was told not just in Auggie's point of view, but also with five other kids who surrounded Auggie's life. This made the book a little easier to relate to because let's admit it: most of us don't have what Auggie has. Of all the characters, I identified the most with his friend, Jack. I really wish I could be like Summer, that I could choose to be kind before anything else. I think Jack represents the side of everyone who tries to be good but fails, and then tries again anyway. And I think the trying is the most important part of it all. \\n There's a lot of buzz with what Wonder teaches, or attempts to teach, but I think maybe we shouldn't over think it too much. Sure, there are some parts that may seem a little simple, that the ending may seem to be a little too nicely wrapped up, almost like how a movie is done and we know real life is never that way. I see it as a simple thing: I see Wonder as a middle grade book that teaches kindness -- to quote, \"...to be kinder than necessary.\" That as human beings, we do not just have \"...the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness...\" and to choose that even when it's not easy, when it's inconvenient, even when it's uncomfortable. \\n Even though reading Wonder reminded me of that particular incident I shared at the start of this review which brought back some of the guilty feelings, this book made me feel a lot better after reading it. A little bit more whole, even. With a stronger resolve to be kinder than necessary. I think that a book that can make its readers feel like that is worth a second glance. || 'Sometimes I think my head is so big because it is so full of dreams'. \\n Wonderful 5 stars ***** \\n Before I say anything else, let me confess, I Ammara Abid, wholeheartedly love this book. \\n A big hand for R.J. Palacio for such an excellent write-up. This book hit me, it hit me hard. I can't explain in words the effect of 'Wonder' on me. I was completely awestruck. \\n I know it's a fiction but what an inspiring fiction it is! \\n Based on the bitter reality of our society and aspired from a little incident in real life. \\n It would urge you to stop and look around, \\n It would urge you to feel, \\n It would urge you to think, \\n to think about the special kids, \\n It would urge you to \\n 'Be HUMAN' \\n &amp; \\n 'Be HUMANE'. \\n Most of the time tears rolling down my cheeks and yet no time to stop. The story is so moving, touching and gripping it grab your attention. There's no way out. You can't put it down. You can't. That's it. \\n Auggie 'the wonder boy' the main character of the book, the story revolves around it but what makes it more amazing is the narration. Not only narrated by Auggie but Via, Summer, Justin, Jack &amp; Miranda too. \\n In the end when the Mr. Tushman announced the final award, Henry Ward Beecher medal, not only his friends cried out loud but me too with tears in my eyes and smile on my face \\n 'a happy crying' :\") \\n I love all the characters and their perspectives. The way story is being told is cherry on the top. \\n Precisely, this book stole my heart. I love it's title too I love everything about it. \\n Do you want some wonderful read? \\n 'Wonder' is your book to hold. \\n Unstoppably amazing \\n \"Surprise is one of those emotions that can be hard to fake, though, whether you're trying to look surprised when you're not or trying to not look surprised when you are.\" \\n My heart weep :'( \\n \"Do people go out of their way to avoid touching you, Via?\" he answered, which left me momentarily without an answer. \"Yeah, right. That's what I thought. So don't compare your bad days at school to mine, okay?\" \\n Modesty :\") \\n \"The main thing I have is this thing called man-di-bu-lo-facial dys-os-tosis--which took me forever to learn how to pronounce, by the way.\" || Incredible, touching book! A MUST read! || I went a bit kicking and screaming into the reading of this one because I thought --- yet another soppy sad story of a kid with a serious problem. Not to mention realistic school stories too often feel forced to this veteran classroom teacher. But as I read further into it I was completely taken in. This is a truly lovely story and beautifully, beautifully told. The movement between different characters' points of view is nicely done. The children and adults all seem real as can be, not a one seemed a straw man or someone pontificating a moral. There were moments when I was brought to tears, but they were genuine moments, not a one felt overly sacharine or manipulative. Nothing, in fact, is the slightest bit manipulative in this book. \\n Nicely done indeed. || 'Wonder' is a great book and a good story well told, aimed squarely at the 'young adult' market. Like many other great novels - due to its strength however, it transcends and easily surpasses the confines of its genre and limited target market. The characters are well developed and not stereotyped, the plot line well-constructed - nice character illustrations too. \\n The main character Auggie has a condition - a rare medical facial deformity (variously described as a facial anomaly, craniofacial difference, mandibulofacial dysostosis) and whilst this is central to the story, on another level that particular issue is almost incidental. This is a story about growing up; it's about being different, lunchbreak and classroom politics. It's about self-acceptance against all the odds, it's about perceived 'otherness' and the consequential bullying. So when I say that Augusts' facial anomaly is almost incidental, what I am trying to say is that this perceived otherness and the associated challenges as a theme for the novel could have been one of many things chosen from a sadly all too long list encompassing so many other aspects including - race, gender, size, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, religion, culture, nationality... \\n The message from this story - being that growing up is hard and that otherness or being 'different' can make things much harder. An important issue also raised here is concerning 'deformity' being misunderstood and wrongly equated with disability or 'special needs'. Often and as in this instance - Auggie has no disability and no 'special needs'. \\n This is an important and thought provoking story. Palacio tells us that 'Wonder' is a \"meditation on kindness - on the impact and transformative power of kindness\". 'Wonder' is a moving and uplifting story of kindness and acceptance - sadly though there will be many out there in life that aren't so lucky and so subject to both. For me though, ultimately and overall - 'Wonder' is about hope, faith in humanity and faith in the human spirit - there is good in us. Leaving us with the simple but obvious and important message that - it's not what you're like on the outside, but you're like on the inside and how you behave that counts. \\n When considering the current political climate on the world stage, where those with perceived 'differences' or otherness are all too often, far from being embraced - but on the contrary are being marginalised and demonised - to me this makes this kind of story is all the more important. \\n I will finish with two of Mr Browne's precepts: \\n 'When given the choice between being right and being kind - choose kind' \\n 'Be kinder than is necessary' \\n A random precept that has always stayed with me: \\n 'Never judge a man until you've walked a mile in his moccasins' \\n And one of my own: \\n 'Everyone is different, everyone is the same, different but equal' || Beautiful reminder of this book which I found on the internet. I just had to share it. \\n Wonder \\n was undoubtedly a memorably read. Between the narrative and the narrative structure and the book's message, it could very well have been phenomenal for me. But it wasn't. It felt to me like a great piece of art with lots of nice parts that didn't fit together enough to merge into one great piece of absolute beauty. Well, something like this. I love that the narrative bounced between characters, allowing us to see what it was like, not just for Auggie, but for all the people affected by Auggie's facial abnormality - even though I appreciated some narratives more than others. It was important to read about the perspectives of some of the people directly and indirectly influenced by him. I definitely loved the themes that inspire one to exercise simple human virtues like patience and kindness. The contrast made between middle school and high school life as Auggie and his sister, Via, try to fit in their respective schools was also something of notability. It's clear that abnormality or not, it's tough trying to fit in and belong in both worlds. School - High, low or middle - can feel like a religion or culture. Or worse, both. \\n I relive moments from this book and it makes me really appreciate the importance of true beauty and human goodness and those who are strong enough to attain it. True beauty is earned, we have to fight everyday to be beautiful inside and I cringe at how easy it is to be the opposite - ugly and cruel. That's one of the finest morals of this story. \\n My biggest problem with the story was the ending was too glassy, too blindly bright and shiny. Too squeaky clean - and dare I say it turned plastic. But(and this is a humongous BUT) like I said, I believe the true beauty of the story lies in the boy behind it - again even if some characters would have been more reader friendly if they had been a little more developed and more interesting in their narratives. All in all, this was a fairly good read. To read Fabian's review, please click here || Auggie Pullman is born with Treacher Collins, a chromosome disorder that results in severe facial deformities. He is homeschooled for many years because of his ongoing need for extensive surgery and his parents' fear about how Auggie will be treated. \\n When Auggie begins fifth grade, his parents decide to send him to school. How Auggie, his family, and his classmates deal with Auggie's transition to school during one school year forms the basis of the storyline. I appreciated the honesty of his situation and how other children respond to Auggie at school. Many kids tease Auggie and the author also shows how Auggie is excluded without being openly bullied. \\n Wonder is a remarkable book about courage, love, and the difference one person can make in the lives of others. Auggie is an inspiring person because he is just an ordinary kid. It isn't just Auggie who inspires you, though, his parents, older sister, his teachers, and his friends and their families show their strength and love for Auggie in their daily interactions with him. \\n While the ending was a little bit like a Hallmark movie, I thought it was appropriate to the mood of the story and the characters' actions. \\n You will cry and smile and think of the special people in your life. Wonder is the sort of book that stays with you. || Great story - felt so very real. Also, I thought I knew what to expect after the first 50 pages or so, but it definitely moved in a variety of different directions throughout. Highly recommend to just about anyone. || I promise I'm not heartless, but I didn't love this book. It wasn't just me either. I buddy read Wonder with my son and he wanted to DNF. It was required summer reading so no such luck for him. Our favorite parts were the precepts at the end. I'm fully aware that our experience is in a crazy minority for this title but that's how it goes sometimes. Neither one of us felt engaged or connected with the characters at any time in this story. We tried though. We took a lot of breaks, discussed the book as it progressed, brainstormed precepts of our own...it just wasn't happening. We wanted this book to be over. Regardless, I would still recommend Wonder to others, because like I said, our experience appears to be rare and the morals of this story are invaluable for every age. You're never too old to practice kindness or to re-evaluate how success is really measured. This book may have sucked for us but the life lessons made it worth it. Two stars instead of one :) \\n Note: The audio narration for Auggie's voice is awful in our opinion. Just because a person may have facial abnormalities does not mean their voice will be equally impaired. I found the narration insulting to Auggie's character and frankly it was grating to listen to based on my personal reading experience. It's hard to say if we would have enjoyed Wonder a bit more if we read it off the page instead. I thought this element was worth noting. \\n My favorite quote: \\n \"Isn't that the most important thing of all? Isn't that the kind of question we should be asking ourselves all the time? What kind of person am I?\" \\n 6/20/16: \\n Buddy read with my boy || my heart is so so so so so so so so so full</td>\n",

It practically begs the reader to come to the conclusion that if you don't \"get it\", it's your own fault because you're a \"grown up, and only kids can see what matters\". The truth is, there's nothing to get. It's heavy handed, clumsily executed observations on what's important in life. It's not wrong by any means, but it's the kind of pseudo-intellectual detritus that \\n freshmen philosophy majors will discuss as they pass the joint. \\n I'm going to go with a literal interpretation of the plot, because why the hell not: \\n A man crashes his plane in the desert, hallucinates a small alien boy that teaches him philosophical lessons, invents a history for him, finds a well just in time to stave off dehydration, as he re-hydrates, his hallucinated alien friend kills himself and disappears, he fixes his plane and flies home and is sad about it, but feels blessed for the experience as it has changed him. \\n Ready for the moral? It's really simple: \\n \"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\" Or in other words, spend your time developing relationships, don't worry so much about the things, they're not important, it's the time you spend and how you spend it that is. \\n That's a nice philosophy, I get it, but this book is silly. || Written as a children's book, I find myself unable to pin down firmly as to what makes The Little Prince such a universally likeable book, be it children or grown-ups. What makes it the Hotel California of literature? \\n Is it because most grown-ups secretly love being treated like kids? I think as a grown-up you ought to know better than that. Grown-ups like to be petted around now and then in jest, but that's the end of it. Often, when grown-ups are indeed treated like kids and they're not in the mood, there is a tiny matchstick inside each one of them, an insecure ego which flares up angrily like it has been wildly struck against a matchbox. In my experience, grown ups like to be taken very seriously. Very very seriously. \\n Is it the clear, simple language? No, it can't be just that. There have been books that have been written with clarity and have been criticized by pedants and pontificating bores for their simplicity. Grown ups like to feel wise and learned by having claimed to read complicated texts that engaged them at an 'intellectual' level. They don't like important things being pointed out to them in simple language, after all they're the know-it-all grown-ups and don't need anybody patronizing them. \\n Is it because the book is so short and grown-ups are always keen on finishing books real quick? No, it can't be just that either. I know grown-ups who believe that a good book, like a well-mixed drink, must be held between the fingers and tended to lovingly at length to let it get to your head. \\n Is it the timeless lessons that the book cushions behind layers of delightful story-telling? Is it the sense of wonder that the book inspires in the most cynical, world-weary adult, if not for posterity then for a day or an hour? I don't know, could be, could be. Worthy contenders they are, but I think I'm not still not home. \\n If I had to lay a bet on it, I'd say everyone adores The Little Prince because we are tired of meeting people from Earth everyday who speak the same dry language of numbers and would love to encounter a sunset-loving, wise prince from the room-sized planet of Asteroid B-612 who talks animatedly about butterflies, baobabs and volcanoes to the child inside us that we've buried long ago underneath the grey tomb of grown-up babble. \\n Kurt Vonnegut once expressed how laughable a critic taking himself too seriously is in these memorable words, \\n \"Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel is preposterous. He or she is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae.\" \\n That is exactly how ridiculous critics who despise The Little Prince are. For The Little Prince is that hot fudge sundae garnished with generous toppings of lost innocence, shared loneliness, deliciously recycled perspective and lessons worth repeating to yourself to keep from succumbing to the unsavoury, contagious disease of adulthood. \\n To make your job easier, here are some lessons from the book worth remembering and repeating: \\n \"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.\" \\n \"People have forgotten this truth,\" the fox said. \"But you mustn't forget it. You become responsible forever for what you've tamed.\" \\n \"One only understands the things that one tames,' said the fox. 'Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me.\" \\n \"\"Grown-ups love figures... When you tell them you've made a new friend they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you \"What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies? \" Instead they demand \"How old is he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make? \" Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.\" || So precious. || wow, whoops. forgot to ever say that i wrote a full(er) review of this and posted it on the ol' blog. my life is definitely together and not at all a mess. find it here: https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co.... along with a review of the little princess. \\n cute, right? i think it's pretty cute. \\n --------------------------- \\n this book was just as lovely the second time as it was the first.

He's bleeding from a gash on his upper arm. He finds he is chained by leg irons to the wall. There is another person sharing his predicament. It's a bear, also chained to the opposite wall. In the center of the floor is the corpse of what appears to be donkey in a pool of blood. Near the corpse are a gun, a tape recorder and a saw. \\n \"Grownups are very strange,\" said the Little Prince to himself, sadly. || Book Review \\n 3 out of 5 stars to The Little Prince, a French children's story written in 1943 by Antoine de Saint-ExupA(c)ry. Have you ever read a book that was translated into your native language and thought, \"I've lost some beauty and meaning in this version?\" That's how I feel about this book. I read it in English as I cannot read, speak or write French. I know very little about the French, but with a few folks I've known, I can align this book with their personalities. Though it's deemed a children's book, in America, we're often a little less willing to give something like this to kids, so it's probably better for a new teenager to read. It has some pictures as well as story, so it's somewhere in the middle of YA versus children's book to me. \\n As for the story, consider it a moral lesson, an allegory, in how to live life. Comparing adults to children. Imagination to work. Freedom to structure. Why you choose to do something versus being told to do it. The characters are a little too direct or cold for me to connect with, but I do enjoy the conversation the book starts with young adults. It can teach you how to think on your own but also recognize there is a time and place for questioning why versus just doing the task. \\n I would like to learn French to see if I read something different from the book. But then again, without years of culture and history, it may not have the same impact as it does for someone who grew up in the environment. Anyone from France have a theory? I'd be curious... \\n About Me \\n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

Thanks for stopping by. || Beautiful dY'oe' || I was excited to get into this book because of its praise and was pleasantly surprised by the drinking allowed to occur within a children's book. The tale was worth reading and I see why someone would enjoy reading it to a child. At its best, The Little Prince encourages children to question authority and demand answers while portraying the adults of the world as confused. But at its worst, that prince was just an anecdotal part of a children's book with less substance than I expected. The part about the \"negro kings\" of Africa was also slightly outdated. || One of the books I remember from my childhood that I am still learning lessons from. || Yes, I know!! \\n I know this book is a piece of brilliance and it supposed to be everyone's favorite, but for me, it is just.... \\n I'm sorry, Little Prince. || Much more heartfelt than your usual constructed new age mysticism, but still falls to false separations and idealism. This is achieved by the inclusion of representational figures which do not stand in allegorically, but rather conceptually, and hence become not pure symbols but a set of tools for the construction of different philosophical scenarios. \\n The book also presents the requisite complexity needed for a holistic view of emotions and interaction, but falls to the very French fault of the author (or author surrogate) declaring themselves entirely correct about points which warrant more discussion and thought. \\n There is a fine line here between using such a representation to further thought by confrontation and trying to quiet it with thought terminating cliches. The reader may decide for themselves when Saint-Exupary crosses from one to the other. \\n It is unfortunate that a staple of children's literature is the stalwart declaration of comforting half-truths, but this is not uncommon even in adult books. Most New Age and Self-Help works are simply an extension of this to the (ostensibly) adult mind. \\n Unlike those myths of self-justification, the Little Prince occasionally presents some sense of wonder and mystery that overcomes the otherwise simple message. Its no Carroll, but there are times that it approaches that level of surrealism that opens a child's mind to something heretofore unimaginable. \\n Yet it is overall too self-satisfied with its message of naive wonder and reassuring but empty 'specialness'. || BookTube-A-Thon Challenege 2016 #1 Read a book with yellow on the cover. \\n BookTube-A-Thon Challenege 2016 #6 Read and watch a book-to-movie adaptation. || sry wl khh khtb rw khwndm bhsh 3 strh ddm , bh nZrm khtb zyd jlby nbwd,t ynkhh mrwz yh br dygh khtb rw b dqt byshtry khwndm \\n by nZyrbwd by nZyr \\n :qsmt hyy z khtb \\n khtrkhy r srG drm khh ykh aq srkh rwy'h twsh zndgy mykhnh. w hych wqt ykh gl r bw nkhrdh, hych wqt ykh strh r tmsh nkhrdh hych wqt khsy r dwst ndshth hych wqt jz jm` zdn `ddh khry nkhrdh. w hm mthl tw SbH t shb khrsh hmyn st khh bgwyd: &lt;&lt;mn ykh adm mhmm! ykh adm mhmm!&gt;&gt; yn r bgwyd w z Grwr bh khwdsh bd khnd. m khyl khrdh: w adm nyst, ykh qrch st! \\n ykh rwz drdi dl khnn bh mn gft: h&lt;&lt;Hqsh bwd bh Hrfhsh gwsh nmyddm. hych wqt nbyd bh Hrf glh gwsh dd. gl r fqT byd bwy'yd w tmsh khrd. gli mn tmmi khtrkhm r m`Tr mykhrd gyrm mn bld nbwdm chhjwry z an ldht bbrm. qDyhy chnglhy bbr khh an jwr damaGm khrdhbwd mybyst dlm r nrm khrdh bshd...&gt;&gt;h \\n ykh rwz dygr hm bh mn gft: h&lt;&lt;an rwzh ntwnstm chyzy bfhmm. mn byst rwy khrd w khri w dr brhsh qDwt mykhrdm nh rwy gftrsh... `Tragynm mykhrd. dlm r rwshn mykhrd. nmybyst zsh bgryzm. mybyst bh mhr w mHbty khh pshti an khlkhhy m`Swmnhsh pnhn bwd py mybrdm. glh purand z yn jwr tDdh. m khb dygr, mn khmtr z an bwdm khh rhi dwst dshtnsh r bdnm!&gt;&gt;h || Where are the people?\" resumed the little prince at last. \"It's a little lonely in the desert...\" \\n \"It is lonely when you're among people, too,\" said the snake. \\n I read somewhere that one word can mean more than than ten thousand.

Stop and smell the flowers || The Little prince is one of those famous books that seems that everyone has to read. In general, I like books with a great thesis that had been written to be understood as a child and as an adult (the two levels), but for me, The Little Prince abuses too much of metaphors and the direction of the moral meaning is too strong. I think its a great book but I didn't like as I thought I liked... \\n Spanish version: \\n El principito parece que es uno de esos libros tan famosos que todos tenemos que leer. En general, me gustan los libros con moraleja, que estan escritos para ser entendidos desde pequeno y desde adulto (dos niveles diferentes), pero el principito a veces se me hace un poco pesado por lo cargantemente metaforico que es. Creo que es un gran libro pero no me gusto tanto como esperaba... || Cuteness overloaded! \\n Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! \\n I will ensure that my kids read The Little Prince and books like this in my bedtime stories. \\n Before that, I want to read it again in French. || One of those books you are never too old and can never re-read enough. Some days, in fact, a book like this is precisely what you need. I was trying to figure out as I read it again what makes the book so \"universal\" so \"classic\" as in, you know, it will continue to be read and re-read forever. It struck me first that there was a quality of genius in the \"tone\" of the narration. Immediately you feel that you are in the presence of a kind, gentle soul. You are at home, take off your shoes, be your poor self, you're with someone who for some reason likes you. I think the \"tone\" of this book, or of any book, is probably the one thing about writing that cannot be learned. It's a touch, a grace given, a gift bestowed to the author. An author has it or an author doesn't. What Saint-Exupery is able to do and what all authors who have this need to do, is find a way to disappear so that the gift passes through the words unimpeded to the reader. The words, of course, need to be clear, simple, humble servants of the gift. That's the case with the words in this book, isn't it? Then I think this book is a classic because of it's spiritual message. When you see the word \"spiritual\" you think preachiness or religion, precepts and dogma, but the spiritual qualities of the book (of any great book) consist more in the way the book opens you, makes you receptive to memory and feeling and loss, reminds you that you are more than matter, more than getting and fretting and dying. There are all these \"things\" inside of you or outside of you that affect you or that you yearn for, things that you can't see with your eyes but which are there, plain as the sunset, as the Little Prince would say, if you would only let your heart see them. || ktbaar prrchi taar phrdd dite aasi naai / aajke prrio naai eittaa / ribhiuo dicchi naa / \\n aami ekttaa kthaa bhaabtechi ei bittaa niyye anekdin dhre, aajke ekjnke blte giyye mne hilo, ekhaane likhe raakhi / \\n aamaar dhaarnnaa ei bi baaccaaraa prrle taader bhaalo laagbe naa / aamaar syaampl spes chotto, ekhn prynt chyyjn baaccaake dichilaam, taader bhaalo laage naai, yaa aamaare ei bissyye aaro kaatthmollaa kreche / \\n aamaar bishbaas ei bittaa hcche seisb biyyer ekttaa, yegulaa prre brrraa ble, aah, aami baaccaa absthaayy ei bi chilo ki / \\n eittaa ekttaa brrder bi / aami brr hile taaraa dibo / ribhiuo tkhni dib / || mdt drzy msfr khwchwlw r ngh khrd. an wqt gft: -gr dlt mykhwhd mnw hly khn! \\n msfrkhwchwlw jwb dd: -dlm khh khyly mykhwhd, m wqti chndny ndrm. byd brwm dwstny pyd khnm w z khly chyzh sr dr arm. \\n rwbh gft: -adm fqT z chyzhyy khh hly khnd mytwnd sr dr ard. nsnh dygr bry sr dr awrdn z chyzh wqt ndrnd. hmh chyz r hmyn jwr HDr amdh z dkhnh mykhrnd. m chwn dkhny nyst khh dwst m`mlh khnd admh mndhnd bydwst... tw gr dwst mykhwhy khb mnw hly khn! \\n msfr khwchwlw prsyd: -rhsh chyst? \\n rwbh jwb dd: -byd khyly khyly HwSlh khny. wlsh ykh khrdh dwrtr z mn mygyry yn jwry myn `lfh mynshyny. mn zyr chshmy nght mykhnm w tw lmtkhm hychy nmygwyy, chwn tqSyr hmhy sw'itfhmh zyr sr zbn st. `wDsh mytwny hr rwz ykh khrdh nzdykhtr bnshyny. \\n trjmh zyby'yst ...</td>\n",

How could we as readers not, after beholding such tragedy? \\n Because the orphans are so likeable, which led me to care for them and their future, I never wanted to stop reading. Being assured that Violet, Klaus and Sunny would find their happily ever after was my first preoccupation. \\n Many events conducted the lives of the Baudelaires and, although they were unmistakably unhappy and antagonistic ones, I found charming how much we learned about the characters from them. \\n However, the story and its protagonists are not the only elements that will enthral readers.

On book 5 I'm thinking we'll probably read them all. \\n EDIT: I have now posted reviews of all 13 books in the series - check them out! \\n You should join my 3-emails-a-year mailing list for updates about my books. #prizes http://eepurl.com/cimnK1 \\n .. || We have in Egypt this saying; \\n \"Who sees the Unfortunate Events of others feel solace about his own Unfortunates\" \\n \"lly yshwf mysfwrshnt yfynts lns thwn `lyh mysfwrshnth\" \\n So, 2016 wasn't my year -EST, 2011- and now I'm hitting \"rock bottom\",having \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" \\n So I said, why not give this title a try \\n \"accompanied by this mysterious black cat that sat with me the whole 2 hours read\" \\n It's really dark-fun Misfortune kids Orphans' story.. \\n And a Gothic villain. \\n And the author himself, Mr. Lemony Snicket; \\n who advises you repeatedly that this book is sad and misfortune and not with a happy endings..and please close it or return it if you can't handle all this misfortune.. \\n Even the TV show latest adaptation tells u to just \\n LOOK AWAY, well... that's true... you should stop reading this review now as well..look for something happier. \\n BUT as our beloved mother Country saying...which I said earlier, I didn't Look Away. \\n And that was.....sickly fun. \\n The Story \\n ------- \\n The Baudelaire 3 children lost their parents, their huge house and everything they own in a fire... But not their huge bank account. \\n Mr.Poe, the banker is the one responsible to see them to the 'proper' guardian. Proper here refer to something that never happened.. oh he delivered them to a guardian, but proper is not a suitable word to describe Count Olaf. \\n Who's has nothing to do with them but plotting to get his hand of their fortune. Which they even can't get their hand on it till the eldest -Violet,14- come of age. \\n To try to get their fortune. He puts them in a Series of Unfortunate Events. \\n And by the second half of the Book One.. his first grand plan is to wed Violet by deceive .. \\n How , how can they know the deceive, how can they escape his plan without endanger their lives??? that's the book one for you. \\n Oh and no matter what do you think.. the author stick to his word. \\n No Happy Endings here.. \\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\n The Writing Style \\n ------------- \\n It's really like children book, the style, the easy sentences and even when the author use a big or fancy word he always give the meaning of it even if it's easy in a very funny way. Also he does that in expressions and literature techniques as well. \\n It's sarcastic and if it's really a children's book..it's the Darkest one ever written. \\n If you read of Mr. Lemony Snicket's real life you'll feel he's been 'forced' somehow to write a children books. It's 1999, the phenomenon of Harry Potter was on the catching fire stage.., that's why the result comes like it's a Satire of children books.. Satire here means a dark fun sarcastic imitation of normal life children books. \\n The creating of the Lemony Snicket constant commentaries through the book as a detective who investigate the Baudelaire orphans' Series and tell this as a story for ether very young readers, or slow ones, that worked as a very funny 'comic relief' amidst all the Misfortune Unfortunate Events Series. \\n 'Comic Relief' here means small funny moments that gets between more tensed or serious ones. \\n Well.. \\n That's it for a small book reviews. I over talked it I guess.. but I really loved this absurd dark fun of... \\n Unfortunate Events. \\n Mohammed Arabey \\n 16 January 2017 \\n To 17 January 2017 || So the premise of this book (as the narrator keeps helpfully reminding us) is that this group of three children will continue to have difficult problems to overcome, and every time they succeed in dealing with one problem, another will crop up. In the writing business, this is what's known as 'a plot'. \\n But then he takes it one step further: in addition to all the difficulties along the way, he assures us that the characters will never break this pattern, and there will be no 'happy ending'. I think this is a good idea, especially in a children's book, because we, as a culture, don't have enough role models for failure. \\n We have lots of role models for how to behave when we win, but this isn't really very useful--it's not when we win that we most need guidance and aid. We need more examples of how to maintain, how to persevere, in the face of failure. \\n At this point, our only role models for what to do when we fail are villains, who tend to get angry, yell, whine, take it out on subordinates, and then develop vengeful plans to make everyone feel as bad as they do. The unfortunate result is that people often begin to act like villains when things don't go well, an effect which can be observed most easily by holding a job where you have a boss. \\n So I'm all for 'no easy wrap ups' at the end of the story, but unfortunately, Snicket is unable to develop a conclusion without this easy route. It takes a very skilled writer to eschew convention and still write something interesting, and his reasons for avoiding standard practices should not be merely to differentiate himself, but to achieve some alternative goal for his story. \\n There are authors who have achieved this, even in children's fiction--Lewis Carroll and Roald Dahl being the preeminent examples. When Snicket laid out the premise of his books, I began to look for something along the lines of those two authors, who, despite creating stories of children suffering constantly and unfairly, managed to write entertaining, enjoyable stories. \\n But then those stories were wild and vivid, even when they were dark. Dahl's ability to create grotesque, powerful characters made for dynamic, engrossing stories, while Carroll's quick, fertile mind kept us always guessing, and often laughing, despite Alice's constant frustrations. \\n Though Snicket is trying for a witty style, he rarely gets there. After the second chapter, all his jokes have already been established, the rest are only minor variations on the same themes. There are no surprising insights to back up his humor, nothing unexpected, just a continuance of the same tone: dry, but not acerbic. \\n The characters, likewise, show little variance. The vocabulary and speech patterns are all very similar, whether adults, children, villains, or heroes. We are often told of differences in character by the narrator, but these never actually make it into the characters' mouths. \\n Since the characters are fairly cliche and undifferentiated, Snicket cannot hang the plot on them, like Dahl would. They cannot provide the vibrant impetus for the plot, so Snicket's plot instead becomes a series of convenient (or conveniently inconvenient) events. \\n The writing itself is not bad, it's mostly just a case of Snicket not being clever or dark enough to buoy his premise. In the end, not much stands out, not the characters, nor the humor. \\n I applaud his attempt to address difficult and painful issues in his books, and without resorting to basic melodrama, but tragedy is measured by the subject's capacity for pain, so characters must be vivid and deep in order for events to feel truly unfortunate; otherwise, it just becomes the same array of problems common to every plot. || Glad to say these lived up the the expectations of my 10-year old self. Off to check out the show! || To Beatrice-darling, dearest, dead. \\n If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book. In this book, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. \\n I think it is important how a book starts, because that sets the tone for the rest of the book. I myself have been guilty of prematurely-\"prematurely\" here means \"before the time is appropriate\"- judging the quality of a book based on its beginning. In this case, however, while the book itself is called The Bad Beginning, there is nothing bad about the beginning of the book itself. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events chronicles the tales of the three Baudelaire siblings. Siblings who are smart, inventive, and just a wee bit precocious. \\n Violet Baudelaire, the eldest, liked to skip rocks. ... Anyone who knew Violet well could tell she was thinking hard, because her long hair was tied up in a ribbon to keep it out of her eyes. Violet had a real knack for inventing and building strange devices, so her brain was often filled with images of pulleys, levers, and gears, and she never wanted to be distracted by something as trivial as her hair. \\n Klaus Baudelaire, the middle child, and the only boy, liked to examine creatures in tidepools. ... He knew how to tell an alligator from a crocodile. He knew who killed Julius Caesar. And he knew much about the tiny, slimy animals found at Briny Beach, which he was examining now. \\n Sunny Baudelaire, the youngest, liked to bite things. \\n What? She is only an infant, after all... \\n Despite the warning at the beginning of the book, one might come to this story with some hope in their hearts. Such people are fools. There is no hope in this story. However, seeing as how this is a children's book, and banking on man's innate nature to seek closure, I would like to go out on a limb and say that eponymous series of unfortunate events, however, do end well for the Baudelaire orphans. Not this book, though, not at all. The Bad Beginning has an equally crappy conclusion. Forgive my alliteration game, it's not as strong as Mr. Snicket's. But then again, he couldn't really alliterate The End either, could he? \\n They didn't understand it, but like so many unfortunate events in life, just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't so. \\n I also strongly believe that a villain makes or breaks a story, and Count Olaf makes this one. He steals the show. Maybe that's just me, because I imagined Neil Patrick Harris's version of it speaking all the lines... Actually, no. It isn't just me. Olaf is so much of an over-the-top villain, it is delightful to read about his schemes, hair-brained and far-fetched as they may be. \\n I don't remember the last time I read a \"children's book\", and let me tell you, the experience is more fun as an adult. Alliterations like \\n Doldrum Drive \\n , \\n Fickle Fountain \\n , and \\n Mulctuary Money Management \\n got my panties in a twist. Or how about this super awesome way of learning new words?! (Side note, if I had a penny for every time the word mean was repeated in any of its forms, I'd be very rich.) Anyway, I digress. Handler uses his book as a teaching tool of sorts, where he uses uncommon words, and then explains their meaning. Such explanation may be circumstantial or literal. \\n ...the sauce simmered, a culinary term which means \"cooked over low heat.\" \\n ...the word \"incentive\" here means \"an offered reward to persuade you to do something you don't want to do\"... \\n \"'Posthaste,'\" he said, \"means--\" \"--means you'll do nothing to help us\"... \\n Klaus sighed, and relinquished--a word which here means \"gave to Count Olaf even though he didn't want to\"--the book on nuptial law. \\n The biggest grammar lesson, that Lemony Snicket focuses on, however, is a lesson that the world very much needs today. \\n It is very useful, when one is young, to learn the difference between \"literally\" and \"figuratively.\" If something happens literally, it actually happens; if something happens figuratively, it feels like it's happening. If you are literally jumping for joy, for instance, it means you are leaping in the air because you are very happy. If you are figuratively jumping for joy, it means you are so happy that you could jump for joy, but are saving your energy for other matters. \\n So yeah, one cannot \"literally have a ball of fire in their throat\" or \"literally jump through hoops to get a job done\" (unless they're circus artistes trained to do such a thing, of course). \\n And finally, Lemony Snicket teaches you the value of family and togetherness, and of the simple pleasures in life. It could be simple sentences like this \\n The smell of cooking food is often a calming one... \\n , or slightly more complex emotions like \\n Sometimes, just saying that you hate something, and having someone agree with you, can make you feel better about a terrible situation. \\n Unless you have been very, very lucky, you have undoubtedly experienced events in your life that have made you cry. So unless you have been very, very lucky, you know that a good, long session of weeping can often make you feel better, even if your circumstances have not changed one bit. \\n Though I'm more often than not unable to take my own advice, I have always emphasised on the benefits of a good, solid cry. It gives you energy to trudge along and complete whatever horrible task it was, or confront whoever it was that made you cry. \\n Oh, it is pertinent here to mention-\"pertinent\", here means important-that this book is a rather good \"How-to\" guide on baby-talk. \\n \"Yeeka!\" Sunny shrieked, which appeared to mean \"How interesting!\" \\n \"Wipi!\" Sunny shrieked, which meant \"I'd much prefer gardening to sitting around watching my siblings struggle through law books.\" \\n So yeah, adults can learn much from this book also. I recommend this one, I do. || This is the first time I have reread this since the first time I read the series. I listened to the audiobook for this and loved it! || People have always told me that this was a dark series, but I didn't expect it to be this dark! This is a children's book series?! :') It was great, I really enjoyed it!! I can't wait to carry on with this series, which to be honest, I wasn't expecting to feel! It was such an interesting, short and quick read and thankfully didn't traumatise me or scar me for life like the movie did at eight years old... || Read this for booktubeathon! \\n I wasn't expecting this book to be as creepy as it was, if I read this when I was younger I would have been terrified! || What can I say? These books are amazing. Lemony Snicket does not dumb things down for children, and for that I am eternally grateful. He uses great words in this book, such as: insipid, aberrant, declaim, predicament, Molotov cocktails, incur, adroit, relinquish, nuptial, posthaste, in loco parentis, and mulctuary. Most of these words are explained in a great, kid-friendly way. A few are not, and that's when the child reaches for his/her dictionary. This is a great way of teaching children new words. \\n Some people, especially older people, have expressed to me their strong dislike of books that are popular today - such as Harry Potter, Divergent, Hunger Games, and A Series of Unfortunate Events. They have told me that they are concerned. Aren't these books too dark for children? Won't reading about death and fighting and hard choices make them scared and confused? \\n I think a lot of people forget that these very things are what hold a child's interest. Worrying about the characters, wondering what will happen to them, feeling a sense of dread when the protagonists land in some sticky situations...all of this leads to the children reading another page and another...to find out what happens. Dumbed-down books with no difficult words and no \"scary\" situations or difficult choices make for dull reading. People forget that the original versions of fairy tales were very dark and scary, and that children love complicated puzzles and complex situations. \\n In addition, this book makes it extremely clear from the onset that it is going to be dark and full of difficulties and distress. It is, after all, called A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. Actually, a good bit of humor comes from Snicket's warnings about how dire the circumstances are in the book and his frequent suggestions that you \"stop reading immediately.\" This, of course, has the opposite effect, and only makes the reader more interested. \\n Actually, in spite of their dark and dismal content, these books are hilarious! Snicket's descriptions are charming and he has a way of writing to his audience that is enchanting and magical. I adore this idea of a \"gothic novel\" for young readers. Adults will love it too, and that makes it even better. \\n When these books came out, I was no longer a child, but I was lucky enough to have a loved one read them out loud to me. I would drive this person to places quite frequently, as that person had no car, and as I drove I was read to out loud in a superb array of voices. I still remember how each of them sounded and they sound the same way in my head even now! Nowadays, I am the one reading this books out loud to children, and I still use those same great voices that my loved one used when reading these books to me! Children LOVE the voices and LOVE the stories. Currently, I know many children who do not read much and tell me that they are \"not into reading\", but have made an exception for this series. Especially since they see the series as \"cool\" and \"not dorky\". Shrug. \\n I have never seen the movie with Jim Carrey and have no desire to. \\n Another thing that I admire about these books is the strong, loving relationship between the Baudelaire orphans. Relying on and trusting each other, they always have each other's backs. They are smart, brave, inventive, and kind. I have a special place in my heart for books with strong sibling relationships, since I truly believe your siblings can be your best friends in life. Even in the most depressing situations, the Baudelaires know that they have each other, and that makes them strong. Family can be a surprisingly stunning asset to have, even when one has no money, no friends, and even sometimes, no real home. || 4 STARS \\n Now that was fun... and dark and mess up. I loved it. Am I evil for liking stories where children get fucked over? I am lol I just love dark middle grade too much. #sorrynotsorry \\n I remember picking up this book in middle school, reading the first few pages and then putting it down. Ever since, I passed these books time after time in stores and libraries and never thought to pick the first book up again... until now. \\n Everyone knows what this book is about so I don't feel the need to explain it but I loved the darkness and humor this book was filled with. Even thought a lot of people hate the movie, I LOVE it and had fun imagining the movie's actors as the characters in his book and it made it all the better for me. I think Jim Carrey did an amazing job at Count Olaf. \\n A lot of people said he didn't do him justice, but to be honest, the book's version of Olaf is pretty tame compared to the movie version. Maybe in the next books he gets worse, but I enjoyed the humor Jim brought to the role and that's one of the reasons I love the movie so much. \\n I can't wait to read The Reptile Room and The Wide Window since they were also adapted in the movie as well and those were my favorite parts of it. \\n I also loved how quick this went by, I read it in a day, which for some is a piece of cake, but for me is a rewarding experience lol \\n Again, I can't wait to dive more into this series and see what other things the orphans get into and what Count Olaf and his #squad got in store. \\n Oh yes, and I want badly to smack myself for not getting into this series sooner. It's going to be a ride, reading all 13 but I will do it in small doses so that I don't exhaust myself. But I am planning on reading the next two in the series very soon. \\n If you haven't read this and you enjoy dark middle grade, READ IT. \\n I'll be talking more about it in my March Wrap Up. \\n -Richard \\n P.S. I want to thank the comments of my most recent video for getting me to get my ass to the library and grab a copy of this book. THANK YOUUUU!! || The show is coming to Netflix and it looks awesome! \\n Trailer \\n The highest review currently showing on my feed is a one star review by an adult who has no children. He read books meant for middle schoolers and found them so bad he hoped to have the opportunity to physically torture the author. Oookkkay.... \\n Well I'm currently reading this series with my daughter and we are delighted with it. \\n There is a strong mystery element that improves as the books go along. My daughter loves this aspect and is constantly guessing about what will happen next. \\n The style is wonderfully unique with a very strong and intrusive narrative voice. As the series continues this begins to make more sense as Snicket becomes a character in the books. \\n The book is also quite humorous. Lj has never been exposed to the sort of duel meaning that is ocassionally employed by Snicket and found it engaging. The definitions of difficult words is really interesting. It would not have worked in a different series but the narrative style allows it and we found it a fun gimmick. It has actually improved her vocab although sometimes the definitions are not quite right and are actually amusing. \\n This is the first series LJ has read with such defined story structure and it appears to have helped with her own story writing. \\n I loved the ingenuity the novels inspire. I also loved that Violet was the inventor. My daughter loves science experiments, building things and coding so it was great to see a female MC that had these traits. We stopped reading How to Train your Dragon before picking this book up because we were 50 pages in and no female had spoken in the novel yet (not one!). So in that regard these books have been wonderful. \\n I would recommend these books to everyone with children. They are great for reading aloud as the writing is clean and sentences are rarely awkward (I still get nightmares about reading all three series in the Deltora quest by Rhodda). \\n They also move along at a brisk enough pace that reading aloud doesn't become tedious (unlike The Hobbit and The Secret Garden which she ended up reading alone). The style won't be for everyone but it will only take children a couple of chapters to decide whether the book is for them. || Despues de todo el hype por la serie de Netflix, las peliculas, el haber conocido en persona al autor (una persona peculiar como las haya) y los \"!Oh, por Dios! ?Eres booktuber y no te has leido los libros de Lemony Snicket?\"... !por fin he empezado esta serie! Y no me emociono mucho. \\n Este primer libro, Un Mal Principio, el primero de once (creo), nos introduce en la historia de como los hermanos Baudelaire se quedan huerfanos y terminan pasando por la custodia de personajes tan horrorosos y negligentes como Mr. Poe y el Conde Olaf. Si bien los chicos son multimillonarios, no pueden hacer uso de su herencia hasta que la hermana mayor, Violet, sea mayor de edad... y aqui empezaran los problemas, pues el Conde Olaf esta decidido a quedarse con toda la fortuna de los hermanos. \\n Si bien el libro es entretenido y me gusta la forma en que esta narrado, no me motivaba a seguir leyendo porque adivine la treta que estaba planeando el Conde Olaf desde la mitad del libro. Y si, se que es un libro infantil, pero hay algunos que han logrado sorprenderme. Lo que si es seguro es que no abandonare la saga (casi nunca lo hago), pues todos me dicen que los libros van mejorando, asi que... !a por ella! || My partner loves these books and has been urging me to read them for years now. Unlike me, the science nerd, she is a word nerd, and I guess I can see her attraction to the book. But I think it was lost on me. \\n If you have no idea of what's going on, and I presume that I am one of the last people on the planet other than some isolated tribes in Papua New Guinea to know the story, three children are suddenly orphaned and sent to live with a distant relative who is a Count. He is a classic evil villain who is only after the children inherited fortune that they cannot touch until adulthood. But the Count has other plans. \\n In my opinion this is as simple as the book gets. Sure there is a little wit and cleverness and some admiring attempt to teach the audience new vocabulary, but I wasn't entertained, I only slightly felt any emotion for the children and the author's constant urgings to put the book down if you don't like it almost had me convinced. \\n Maybe you have to be in the series for the long game, to build up an emotional attachment to the children. Maybe you need to be an 8 year old. Maybe you just need to stop thinking about an older relative attempting to marry a fourteen year old girl and then insisting they go back to his place on the marriage night. Yeah, bad creepy book. Not good creepy book. Maybe I am just overthinking a simple kids book. \\n Will I read more? I don't know. || I was right to retain such a strong opinion of Snicket. These books were very important to my childhood and it's still brilliant. His style is so unique, clever and likeable. His stories and characters are gripping and original. This book is a great start to one of the best children's series ever. \\n Re-reading this book as an adult, and the whole series, is so very rewarding, because you pick up on lots of references you didn't get as a kid, and can appreciate its messages so much after you've been through growing up and everything life throws at you. || My heart sank while reading this. || *reread: 1-(29-30)-17* \\n Sadly this wasn't as good as I remember it. There was intrigue, but it was diluted but the writing and the characters seemed different, but sometimes I felt annoyed by their monotone-ness? || Esta por salir la serie en Netflix y ya saben, pecado no leer los libros antes. || 3.75/5 \\n This was so much fun! \\n I guess I'm one of those rare people who never got to read these books when they were a kid, so I have no nostalgic memories attached to this series whatsoever. That being said, I couldn't be more sorry about it. \\n Gaaah! If I could only turn back time and give this to 8 year old me! \\n While this first book is only an introduction to the story and the characters, I'm already so fond of it. The atmoshpere is eerie and weird and creepy at times and the characters are so cool and quirky! Count Olaf is one rather scary and odd specimen, but he's such a good villain. The writing is witty and so easy to get through and I can't praise it enough. \\n And now onto the next books and the Netflix series (which is the reason why I decided to dive into these books in the first place).</td>\n",

Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius.

Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.\\nAugust (Auggie) Pullman was born with a facial deformity that prevented him from going to a mainstream school--until now. He's about to start 5th grade at Beecher Prep, and if you've ever been the new kid then you know how hard that can be. The thing is Auggie's just an ordinary kid, with an extraordinary face. But can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, despite appearances?\\nR. J. Palacio has written a spare, warm, uplifting story that will have readers laughing one minute and wiping away tears the next. With wonderfully realistic family interactions (flawed, but loving), lively school scenes, and short chapters, Wonderis accessible to readers of all levels.   \n",

It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children. Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives filled with misery and woe. From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say they are magnets for misfortune.\\nIn this short book alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, and cold porridge for breakfast.\\nIt is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing.\\nWith all due respect,\\nLemony Snicket   \n",

       "110278  Lowry's book is a piece of nationalist propaganda, using oversimplification, emotional appeals, and dualistic morality to shut down her readers' minds. More troubling is that it is aimed at children, who don't yet have the critical faculties to defend themselves from such underhanded methods. \\n Unsurprisingly, Lowry adopts the structure of the monomyth, equating a spiritual journey with a moral one. Her Christ-figure uses literal magic powers to rebel against his society. This rebellion and the morality behind it are presented as 'natural', to contrast with the 'abnormal morality' around him. \\n Lowry doesn't seem to understand that we get our morality from our culture, it isn't something in-born that we 'lose'. This is the first hint of Lowry's misunderstanding of the human mind. She assumes her own morality is correct, and then builds her story to fit it. \\n She also makes the character act and think like a modern person would, despite never adequately explaining how he came up with such unusual notions. It's the same trick many historical fiction authors use, leaving us scratching our heads as to why a Fourteenth Century French peasant speaks like a second-wave feminist. I'd suggest that Lowry falls to this fault for the same reason they do: she has no talent for imagining how others might think differently. \\n Lowry's book ends with the standard nonspecific transgressive spiritual event that marks any overblown monomyth. Since the book is not a progressive presentation of ideas, it does not suggest any conclusion. Instead, the climax is a symbolic faux-death event (symbolic of what, none can say). Confusingly, Lowry later redacts the ending in the sequels, undermining the pseudo-spiritual journey she created. \\n Though some call this book 'Dystopian', it's closer to the truth to say Lowry borrows elements from the Dystopian authors, attempting to combine the spiritual uplift of the monomyth with the political and social deconstruction of the Dystopia. What she doesn't recognize is that the faith of the one conflicts with the cynicism of the other. She draws on ideas and images from many other authors: Bradbury, Huxley, Orwell, Burgess, but doesn't improve upon them. \\n These authors created novels that reflected the world around them. They based them on the political events of the times, presented with realism and careful psychology. Though they presented the struggle between the individual and the society, they portrayed morality as grey, and suffering as the result of individual human faults, not political systems. Lowry doesn't realize that the best way to critique Fascism or Communism is not to present it as 'evil', but to simply present it as it was. \\n But Lowry's world is not based in reality, it is symbolic and hyperbolic. Instead of writing about how poverty makes the world seem small and dull, she has the characters magically unable to experience life. Instead of an impersonal government, she presents a sort of evil hippy commune. \\n The only political system it resembles is a school, which is a neat little trick to get the kids interested. The idea that 'school=unfeeling totalitarian hell' is not an uncommon one, but it's one I'm surprised teachers would support. The book also suggests a creche, but lacking similarity to any real-world system, it doesn't work as a political criticism. \\n Lowry creates this artificial world to suit her purposes, but it is not a symbolic exercise like 'Animal Farm'. We understand that the pigs of animal farm are symbolic, because there are no talking pigs. Lowry's world is more insidious, since its oversimplification is hidden. She builds an artificial world to support the dualist morality that she's pushing. She presents the same knee-jerk fears about euthanasia and abortion that people use against Women's Rights or Health Care. \\n Worse than these Straw Man arguments is the fact that she never deals with the economic causes of totalitarianism. Tyrants don't just rise up and take control by their own force of will, they come into power because of the socioeconomic situations that surround them. Lean times produce strong, fascist leaders while profitable times produce permissive, liberal societies. \\n Strong, centralized leadership simply doesn't self-propagate in cultures where everyone is clothed, fed, and housed. The Holocaust was socially about some ideal of 'change' and 'purity', but it was economically about the transmission of wealth from Jews, Poles, and Catholics to Germans (and more specifically, to those Germans who had elected the new ruling party). \\n The atrocities of war are, for the most part, committed by normal people on other normal people. By presenting the power structure as 'amoral' and 'inhuman', Lowry ignores the fact that people will willingly cause others to suffer. Painting the enemy as 'evil' and 'alien' is just an unsophisticated propagandist method. \\n She contrasts her 'evil' with the idealized 'goodness' of emotion, beauty, and freedom. This is nothing more than the American dream of 'specialness' that Mr. Rogers was pushing for so many years. We are all special, we are all good, we all deserve love and happiness. Sure, it sounds good, but what does it mean? \\n Where does this 'specialness' come from? If it is just the 'sanctity of human life', then it's not really special, because it's all-encompassing. If all of us are special, then none of us are. There's nothing wrong with valuing life, but when Lowry presents one mode of life as valuable and another as reprehensible, she ceases to actually value humanity as a whole. Instead, she values a small, idealized chunk of humanity. 'People are good, except the ones I don't like' is not a moral basis, nor is it a good message to send to kids. \\n If the specialness is only based on fitting in with a certain moral and social guideline, then Lowry isn't praising individuality, she's praising herd behavior. The protagonist is only 'special' because he has magic powers. His specialness is not a part of his character, it is an emotional appeal. \\n The idea of being a special individual is another piece of propaganda, and its one kids are especially prone to, because kids aren't special: they are carefully controlled and powerless. Giving a character special powers and abilities and then using that character to feed a party line to children is not merely disingenuous, it's disturbing. \\n There is also a darker side to universal specialness: giving a child a sense of importance without anything to back it up creates egotism and instability. Adults noticed that children with skills and friends had high self-esteems, but instead of teaching their children social skills and knowledge, they misunderstood the causal relationship and tried to give them self-worth first. \\n Unfortunately, the moment unsupported self-worth is challenged, the child finds they have nothing to fall back on. Their entitlement didn't come from their skills or experiences, and so they have nothing to bolster that sense of worth. Instead, any doubt sends them down a spiral of emotional instability. \\n A single book like this wouldn't be the cause of such a state in a child, but it does act as part of the social structure built to give a sense of worth without a solid base for that worth. People like to believe they are special, kids especially so, but being a remarkable person is not a result of belief but of actions. If the book had informed them, then it would leave them better off, but giving them a conclusion based on emotional appeals does nothing to build confidence or character. \\n Many people have told me this book is good because it appeals to children, but children often fall for propaganda. Children develop deep relationships with pop stars, breakfast cereals, and Japanese monsters. This does not make them good role models for children. \\n Feeding 'specialness' to kids along with a political message is no better than the fascist youth programs Lowry intends to criticize. The obsession with individuality is just another form of elitism. It's ironic that people in America most often describe themselves as individuals when pointing out the things they do to align themselves with groups. \\n But banding together in a community is not a bad thing. For Lowry and other 'Red Scare' children, any mention of 'communal' can turn into a witch hunt, but we all give up some personal rights and some individuality in order to live in relatively safe, structured societies. There are benefits to governmental social controls and there are drawbacks, and it's up to us to walk the line between the two. Anarchy and Totalitarianism never actually exist for long: we are social animals. \\n It's not difficult to understand why Lowry is so popular, especially amongst educators. The message she gives aligns perfectly with what they were taught as kids, from Red Scare reactionism to the hippy-dippy 'unique snowflake' mantra. These ideas aren't entirely misguided, either. It's good to recognize the benefits of difference and the dangers of allowing other to control our lives. \\n If a reader believes that fascism and socialism are inherently wrong and that their own individuality is their greatest asset, they will likely sympathize with Lowry's work. However, this doesn't make the book honest, nor beneficial. One of the hardest things we can do as readers is disagree with the methods of authors we agree with ideologically. \\n It makes us feel good to find authors who agree with us, but this is when we should be at our most skeptical. Searching the world for self-justification is not a worthwhile goal, it simply turns you into another short-sighted, argumentative know-it-all. 'Yes men' never progress. \\n Lowry is toeing the party line. She does not base her book around difficult questions, like the Dystopian authors, but around easy answers. She doesn't force the reader to decide for themselves what is best, she makes it clear what she wants us to think. Her book is didactic, which means that it instructs the reader what to believe. \\n Even if her conclusions about Individuality vs. Community are correct, she doesn't present arguments, she only presents conclusions. Like rote memorization or indoctrination, she teaches nothing about the politics, social order, economics, or psychology of totalitarianism or individuality. The reader is not left with an understanding, just an opinion. \\n The baseless 'individuality' of the book lets the reader imagine that they are rebels--that they are bucking the system even as they fall into lock-step. By letting the reader think they are already free-thinking, Lowry tricks them into forgetting their skepticism. \\n She is happy to paint a simple world of black and white, and this is likely the world she sees. I doubt she is purposefully creating an insidious text, she just can't see past her own opinions. She writes this book with a point to make, and makes it using emotional appeals and symbolism. She doesn't back it up with arguments because she doesn't seem to have developed her opinions from cogent arguments. \\n In the end, she doesn't show us that the structure of this society is wrong, she says nothing poignant about individuality vs. community; instead, she relies on threats to the life of an innocent infant. Yet nowhere does she provide an argument for why communal living or the sacrifice of freedoms for safety must necessarily lead to infanticide. \\n In politics, making extreme claims about the opposing side is called mud-slinging, it is an underhanded and dishonest tactic. It works. Arguing intelligently is difficult, accusing is easy, so that's what Lowry does. \\n She is another child of WWII and the Cold War who hasn't learned her lesson. She quickly condemns the flaws of others while failing to search out her own. Even after the Holocaust, there are many racist, nationalist, violent Jews; conflict rarely breeds a new understanding. \\n America condemned the faceless communal life of the Second World, and yet America created The Projects. We critiqued strong governmental controls, but we still have the bank bailout, socialized medicine, socialized schooling, and socialized charity. America condemned the Gulags and Work Camps, and yet we imprison one out of every hundred citizens; far more than Stalin ever did. Some are killed, all are dehumanized. \\n As a little sci fi adventure, the book isn't terrible. It's really the pretension that goes along with it. Lowry cobbles together religious symbolism and Dystopic tropes and then tries to present it as something as complex and thoughtful as the authors she copied. Copying isn't a crime, but copying poorly is. \\n Like Dan Brown or Michael Crichton, she creates a political pamphlet of her own ideals, slaps a pretense of authority on it, and then waits for the money and awards to roll in--and they did. Many people I've discussed this book with have pointed to those awards as the surest sign of this book's eminent worth. \\n Award committees are bureaucratic organizations. Their decisions are based on political machinations. This book is a little piece of Nationalism, and so it was lauded by the political machine that Lowry supports. The left hand helps the right. If awards are the surest sign of worth, then Titanic is a better movie than Citizen Kane. \\n What surprises me is how many of those who brought up the award as their argument were teachers. If a politically-charged administrative committee is the best way to teach children, then why do you take umbrage when the principal tells you that bigger class sizes (and fewer benefits) are fine? Listen to him: doesn't he have award plaques? \\n The other argument is usually that 'kids like it'. I usually respond that kids also like candy, so why not teach that? Some people also get angry at me for analyzing a book written for children: \\n \"Of course it's not a great book, it's for kids! If you want a good book, go read Ulysses!\" \\n I prefer to give children good books rather than pieces of political propaganda (even if they agreed with me). Children can be as skeptical, quick-witted, and thoughtful as adults if you give them the chance, so I see no excuse for feeding them anything less. \\n Kids aren't stupid, they just lack knowledge, and that's a fine distinction. It's easy for adults to take advantage of their naivete, their emotionality, and their sense of worth. Just because it's easier for the teacher doesn't mean it's better for the child. \\n When we show children something that is over-simplified, presenting an idealized, crudely moralizing world, we aren't preparing them for the actual world. If you give a child a meaningless answer to repeat, he will repeat it, but he won't understand why. \\n Why not give the child a book that presents many complex ideas, but no rote answers, and let them make up their own minds? If they don't learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff and form their own opinions early, in a safe, nurturing environment, what chance will they have on their own as adults? \\n In all the discussions and research regarding this book, I have come across very little analysis. It's especially surprising for a book with such a strong following, but there aren't many explanations of why the book is supposed to be useful or important. \\n This lack of argument makes sense from a political standpoint, since there is no reason to analyze the worth of propaganda: its worth is that it agrees with society and indoctrinates readers. Analyzing it would defeat the purpose; political diatribes do not stand up to thoughtful attention. \\n Perhaps someday someone will create a thoughtful, textual analysis of this book that will point out its merits, its structure and its complexity. I've gradually come to doubt it. I never expected when I wrote my original review of this book that it would garner this much attention. \\n I still welcome comments and thoughts, but if your comment looks roughly like this: \\n \"You should read this book again, but this time, like it more. You think you're smart but you aren't. You're mean. Lowry is great. This book won awards and kids like it. It's meant for kids anyways, why would you analyze what its about? I bet you never even read the sequels. Go read 'Moby Dick' because you are full of yourself.\" \\n I've heard that one before. If you do want to comment though, you might check out this article; I find it helps me with presenting my ideas. || ** spoiler alert ** \\n If there are no wrong answers, can we really say that something has any meaning? \\n It is very easy to start an interesting science fiction story. Simply begin with a mystery. Don't explain things to the reader and leave them in a state of wonder. In this way, everything will seem interesting, intriguing, and worth exploring. Tap into the reader's powers of imagination and allow them to make your story interesting in ways you need not imagine, and perhaps cannot create. This is a good plan for starting a science fiction story. Lots of science fiction stories begin in this way. On television, almost all of them do - 'X-Files', 'Lost', 'Battlestar Galactica', 'The 4400', 'The truth is out there.' 'They have a plan.' \\n 'The Giver' starts in this way. In the first few pages as the setting unfolded, I was struck by the parallels to China after the cultural revolution - the bicycles, the uniform-like clothing, the regulated life, the shame based culture, and 'the sameness'. I also thought of China, because I immediately grasped that this had to be a culture which was designed to gently crash its population. There were many clues that the world was heavily overpopulated and the primary goal of the culture so described was to crash the population without descending into society destroying anarchy - the highly regulated birthrate, which was insufficient to sustain the population. To sustain the population, more than 17 out of each 25 females would have to be assigned to be birth mothers, and this clearly wasn't the case. The replacement rate for a society is about 2.3 live births per female (maybe 2.1 in a society that is safe and careful) - clearly they were implied to be below this ratio so clearly this was a society that was trying to shed population. \\n Equally clearly, this was a society that engaged in widespread euthanasia for the most trivial of causes, which hints at a culture which doesn't value life because people are in such abundance that they can be readily disposed of. I suspected that 'Release' was euthanasia almost immediately from the context in which it was introduced, and this was almost immediately confirmed when it was revealed that infants were subject to 'release'. Clearly, infants can't be meaningfully banished, so clearly release was euthanasia. So I was intrigued by the story. I wanted to see what happened to Jonas and his naive family who had so poised themselves on the edge of a great family wrecking tragedy in just the first few dozen pages of the story. I wanted to receive from the storyteller answers to the questions that the story was poising, if not some great profound message then at least some story that followed from what she began. \\n But it was not to be. The first clue that the whole construct was to eventually come crashing down was that Jonas clearly didn't understand 'release' to mean 'euthanasia'. Nor in fact did anyone seem to know what 'release' meant. This shocked me, because in the context of the setting it was virtually impossible that he and everyone else did not know. I could very easily imagine a stable society where human life was not prized - after all, societies that believe that human life is intrinsically valuable are historically far less common than ones that don't. We know that the society is life affirming, both because we are told how pained and shocked they are by loss and by the fact that Jonas responds to scenes of death with pity and anger. What I could not believe in was a society which held the concept of 'precision of language' so tightly and so centrally that the protagonist could not imagine lying could in fact be founded on lies. That's impossible. No society like that can long endure. Some technological explanation would be required to explain how the society managed to hide the truth from itself. If release took place in some conscious state of mind, then surely the dispensers of Justice, the Nurturers, the Caregivers, and the sanitation workers would all know the lie, and all suspect - as Jonas did - that they were being lied to as well. Surely all of these would suspect what their own future release would actually entail, and surely at least some of them would reject it. Surely some not inconsequential number of new children, reared to value precision of language and to affirm the value of life, would rebel at the audacity of the lie if nothing else. Even in a society that knew nothing of love, even if only the society had as much feeling as the members of the family displayed, and even if people only valued others as much as the Community was shown to value others, surely some level of attachment would exist between people. Soma or not, the seeds of pain, tragedy, conflict and rebellion are present if ever the truth is known to anyone. \\n Nothing about the story makes any sense. None of it bears any amount of scrutiny at all. The more seriously you consider it, the more stupid and illogical the whole thing becomes. We are given to believe that the society has no conception of warfare, to the point that it cannot recognize a child's war game for what it is, and yet we are also given to believe that they train pilots in flying what is implied to be a fighter craft and that the community maintains anti-aircraft weapons on a state of high alert such that they could shoot down such a fighter craft on a moments notice. We are given to believe that all wild animals are unknown to the community, yet we are also given to believe that potential pest species like squirrels and birds are not in fact extinct. How do you possibly keep them out of the community if they exist in any numbers elsewhere? We are given to believe that technology exists sufficient to fill in the oceans and control the weather and replace the natural biosphere with something capable of sustaining humanity, but that technological innovation continues in primitive culture. We are given to believe that they are worried about overpopulation and starvation, and yet also that most of the world is empty and uninhabited or that this inherently xenophobic community lives in isolation if in fact it doesn't span the whole of the Earth. We are given to believe that this is a fully industrial society, yet the community at most has a few thousands of people. Surely thousands of such communities must exist to maintain an aerospace industry, to say nothing of weather controllers. Why is no thought given to the hundreds of other Receivers of Memory which must exist in their own small circles of communities in the larger Community? Surely any plan which ignores the small communities place in the larger is foredoomed to failure? Surely the Receiver of Memory knows what a purge or a pogrom is? \\n How are we to believe that Jonas's father, whose compassion for little Gabriel is so great that he risks breaking the rules for his sake, whose compassion for little Gabriel is so great that he risks face by going to the committee to plead for Gabriel's life, whose compassion for little Gabriel is so great that he discomforts himself and his whole family for a year for the sake of the child, is the same man who so easily abandons that same child at a single setback when he has witnessed the child grow and prosper? Doesn't it seem far easier to believe that this same man, who is openly scornful of the skills and nurturing ability of the night crew, would more readily blame the night crew for Gabriel's discomfort? I can only conclude, just as I can only conclude about the illogical fact that no one knows what release is, that everything is plastic within the dictates of the plot. Jonas's father feels and acts one way when the needs of the plot require it and feels and acts in different ways when the needs of the plot require something else. What I can't believe is that this is any sort of whole and internally consistent character or setting. Every single thing when held up to the light falls apart. There is not one page which is even as substantial as tissue paper. \\n It is almost impossible to draw meaning from nonsense, so it is no wonder that people have wondered at the ending. What happens? The great virtue of the story as far as modern educators are probably concerned is that there are no wrong answers. What ever you wish to imagine is true is every bit as good of answer as any other. Perhaps he lives. Perhaps he finds a community which lives in the old ways, knowing choice - and war and conflict (which probably explains why the community needs anti-aircraft defenses). But more likely from the context he dies. Perhaps he is delusional. Perhaps he gets to the bottom and lies down in the deepening snow which the runners can no longer be pushed through and he dies. Perhaps he dies and goes to heaven, maybe even the heaven of the one whose birthday is celebrated by the implied Holiday. Perhaps it is even the case that he was sent to his death by the cynical Giver, who knew his death was necessary to release the memories he contained by to the community. Perhaps he didn't just die, but was slaughtered as the sacrificial lamb - killed by a murderous lie from the one he trusted too well. For my entry in the meaningless answers contest, I propose that the whole thing was just a dream. This seems the easiest way to explain the contradictions. A dream doesn't have to make sense. And the biggest clue that it is a dream is of course that Jonas sees the world in black and white, with only the occasional flashes of recognized color around important colorful things as is typical of that sort of black and white dream. Perhaps Jonas will wake up and engage in dream sharing with his family, and they will laugh at the silliness and then go to the ceremony of twelves. Or perhaps the whole community is only a dream, and Jonas will wake up and go downstairs and open his Christmas presents with his family. || Woah, I can easily understand why such a grand amount of people loved this book and definitely see why many were not satisfied with the movie. I cannot believe how many elements of this story they changed. However, there is something that I must admit: I preferred the movie because of how melancholic and hopeful it made me feel and for the suspense inside it that the book irrevocably lacked. It is not something that I hear myself say often at all. I have always been that little full of criticism girl who could not help but compare books to movies and movies to books. Quite a negative experience I tend to have with the latter. I mean, Red Riding Hood (trailer), starring Amanda Seyfried, was enticing! Reading the film-to-novel adaptation though felt like walking through mud - tiring, boring, and endless. Why I granted it a three star rating is beyond me. \\n Let's just put that aside though. After all, it is of The Giver that I shall talk about and my time spent reading the story was definitely not wasted - hence the four star rating - even if not what I anticipated. First, the hero was very young, a detail that I seemed to have forgotten before starting this read. Not a problem though, for Jonas showed an impressive and admirable maturity in his character. Even I, at twelve, and others around me at that time, were not as reflective, wise and...intelligent. Sure, math held no secrets from me, but I was not actually resolving problems for the greater good or aware of the true face of the world. As opposite as the situation and context definitely were, the fact remains that Jonas lead this story with greatness and, along the way, opened my eyes to some beautiful themes. \\n It shook me to witness how unimportant Fiona appeared and how no chemistry was palpable between Jonas and her. Apparently, they were friends through Ashen mostly, or at least that is what I deducted. Of course, they volunteered together but it is not as if they talked and shared moments like true friends normally do. Plus, we could barely see her because of how her presence was omitted. Ashen was definitely endearing in this while, in the cinematographic adaptation - I apologies for bringing it up again - I growled at him continuously. \\n This was another example of a book with fine simplistic writing. My first one, I believe, was Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe. Then I discovered some others and familiarized myself with this type of writing. I am completely in favour of it since it can bring such a peaceful atmosphere to stories and make the reader easily understand every detail written. However, there is something that I unluckily often stumble upon when this style is present and this was no exception: repetition. But maybe it is easier to distinguish it since everything in the writing is clearer? \\n Even though I brought up an equal - or so it seems - amount of positive and negative elements for The Giver, I must let you know that the negative ones never bothered, annoyed or frustrated me. They were there, and I was aware of them, but never let any of those weaknesses keep me from enjoying my read. Because I did. So much. \\n PS. For a couple of minutes, I thought that I just read one of the first dystopian books ever written, but this list proved me the contrary. || My Reaction After Reading This: \\n 2 stars \\n Whoa? \\n Why? \\n Really? \\n SO FIRST OFF I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I REALLY REALLY REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS BOOK SINCE MANY HUMAN BEINGS READ AND LOVE THIS BOOK AND MANY HAVE CONSIDERED THIS AS ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL TIME AND BEFORE I POSTED MY RATING I BROWSE THE RATINGS OF OTHER GR MEMBERS SO THAT I KNOW THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY ABNORMAL HUMAN BEING WHO DOESN'T THINK THAT THIS BOOK IS GOOD OR GREAT OR WHATEVER!!! \\n (*coughs* sorry I forgot to turn off the CAPSLOCK, I'm not shouting or anything *coughs* just please don't judge me *coughs* if you like the book, I respect you for that, but I really can't force myself into believing I like this book _(>.<)V) \\n Okay I'll try to explain what I don't like about it: \\n 1. The book is boring. \\n 2. The book is weird. \\n 3. I don't feel any emotions at all towards the character. \\n 4. I don't really understand the book. \\n 5. I don't really understand the ending. \\n 6. I don't really understand why this Utopia world should have no colors, no feelings and no music so that the people would live *coughs* decently. \\n 7. I don't really understand why the children at age whatever should be given ribbons, what's the purpose of that? \\n 8. I don't really understand why the characters should tell about their dreams to their parents. \\n 9. I don't understand why Johnas has to take medications because he was having Stirrings. So stirrings for those who haven't read the book is somewhat closer to wet dreams. \\n 10. I don't understand why the memories of war, loss etc. would make someone want to end his/her life or give up on life. I know that life is imperfect but it seems that the characters have no backbone, like idk I don't buy the logic of that one. \\n 11. In short I don't really understand this at all! \\n If you're wondering whether I've read this one because it's a school requirement, the answer is NO. I buy this book because I've seen it on the list of best YA book here on Goodreads so many times. And if these book is bombarded with symbolism then please explain this to me(since I don't have brains for symbolism PEOPLE!), especially the ending (What the Fudge is that?) and I might change my rating, I repeat might. || I Loved it, I remember reading it on the beach :D, Major worldbuilding, a chilling and exciting story line, a very interesting dystopian novel. \\n In this book everyone is identical, choices are very limited. Every aspect of life is controlled and decided by elders of the community, everyone is content simply because they don't know any different, but Jonas (the hero) is different, he sees things no one else can see. \\n \"Jonas's world is perfect. Everything is under control. There is no war or fear or pain. There are no choices. Every person is assigned a role in the Community. When Jonas turns twelve, he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver. The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life. Now, it is time for Jonas to receive the truth. There is no turning back.\" \\n Jonas is chosen to be the next \"Receiver\", The giver is the only man in the community who holds memories like color, sun, pain, war, courage, happiness, Love, emotions because the people can't handle them and in case they needed guidance, Jonas slowly receives memories from the giver, Through his training, he discovers secrets of the time before theirs, and discovers that the Community is not as perfect as it seems. \\n \"The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.\" || (3.5) Not really surprising but turns out this is more enjoyable when you actually understand English! || The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared. \\n Wow... just wow. \\n I'm really ashamed that I haven't picked up this book sooner. I went on a vacation today, and I spent more than 10 hours in the bus, so I brought few short books to kill the time and this book was one of them. If it wasn't for this trip, who knows when I would pick it up. \\n I devoured every single page of this book so fast, and in the end I was left wanting more. But I do have to say that I'm not sure if I will read the sequels, because I think that this was the perfect way to end this book. \\n Amazing book and I'm sure I'll be re-reading it in the future many, many times. || I believe I would have liked this more if I had read it when I was younger, but who actually reads when they are younger. It needed something more and I will never understand how The Giver could have explained every great feeling that existed in the past without describing sex.

The story is okay, the message (we are all entitled to have choices, don't let anybody else think for yourself, blah blah blah) is okay, the characters are all transparent (yes, even the Giver himself) and I can't help but think that such a theme was tackled before (Animal Farm, Anthem or Fahrenheit 451 come to mind; even City of Ember to some extent, although it was written way after The Giver) and in a much better and satisfying way. The ending is a bit of a letdown but, failing to care for the main character, I wasn't too bugged by it either. So there you have it. || This wonderful novel will at times make you feel sad, sick and desperate, but you will find hope again and cherish what we have in life: love and happiness along with pain, and friends and family along with the bullies and enemies. Unlike the people in the Giver, we can see all the colors and hear all the sounds even those we don't like. It's all because we have freedom to choose (most of the time). \\n The ending left me baffled though. I know the author wanted it open ended. She then got bombarded with children's letters over the years so she reluctantly wrote the sequels, which clarified it. \\n Still, a clear five-star book. Enjoy! || Being a student at the time, The Giver didn't seem to 'hit the spot' so to speak. As a 16 year old teen, it's funny to say \"I live to read, read to live\" but it's true. Let's just say I wouldn't live to read The Giver. || Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ \\n What would you give to live in a perfect world? \"A life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.\" What if all your needs were taken care of and you were guaranteed shelter, employment, food, clothing, etc.? What if that world protected you from ever making a wrong choice? What if those choices were things like choosing your own spouse, your own job, how many children to have, if you were allowed to have children at all? What if those choices made words like \"love\" obsolete? You see, \"love\" is such a generic term that it shouldn't be used in conversation. Do you really \"love\" your child? Wouldn't you rather pinpoint characteristics you find admirable rather than using such a broad term? Wouldn't that be safer? \\n One of the most profound books I've read this year. When I started The Giver I felt, almost immediately, that it should be required reading. I wasn't surprised to hear that a different Lowry book (Number the Stars) had been assigned to my son's middle-school class. At just the right length, and a pace that keeps everything flowing, The Giver is filled with \"A-Ha Moments\" and the all-important moral that \"it's the choosing that's important, isn't it?\" || Jonas grows up in a community where everybody and everything are the same. The people do not have choices, everything is chosen for them. It is known in the community that once a child turns twelve, they are assigned to a job which they must start training for. \\n Once Jonas turns twelve he is assigned the position of the Receiver of Memories, the person who the Giver, the keeper of memories, gives memories of the past. But Jonas will struggle with many of the memories that he receives such as pain, starvation, pollution and war. Jonas will learn the secrets and sacrifices that were made to create his perfect community. He like the Receivers before him must decide if he can bare the tremendous responsibilities of being the next Giver. And if he can't he feels he must find a way to escape the community. \\n This is not a book I would normally read, but in saying that I thought it was a good read and quite entertaining. This is a book which I'm sure many have enjoyed and will continue to enjoy. || Reading The Giver right after finishing Williams' Stoner was a mistake. Now that I'm done with it, I feel like I had just completed a satisfying meal complimented by a delicious dessert, only to reach for a glass, take a sip, and find out it has sea water in it. My palate is ruined. \\n I must admit that, before writing this review, I looked at some of the reviews posted on Goodreads. I also must admit that either my literary tastes have been spoiled by past quality offerings, or that most of the [over one million] people who rated this book have no idea what quality fiction is. Whatever the real case might be, I feel sad. \\n Where should I begin? Oh yes, at the beginning. The Giver lacks originality. Those who read widely will probably find elements from other books and stories, done and overdone ad nauseum. \\n The premise of The Giver vaguely resembles the ideas put forth by Plato about 2500 years ago in his The Republic. The idea of a society where predetermined ideas replace choices for the greater benefit of an unknowing populace has also been explored in many utopian and dystopian books alike. Unlike the original proponents of such ideas, The Giver does not have a clear path to follow, as it dabbles in both utopia and dystopia without any clear direction. The entire book is composed of a fabric so full of holes, that an alert reader simply cannot take the information presented for granted. \\n Instance after instance, the reader is offered a 'fact' which contradicts reason, yet the author either does not consider the reader intelligent enough to see this, or valuable enough to bother with an explanation. Simply put, the author asks the reader to suspend disbelief without providing the necessary path for this to occur. To me, this is both insulting and a sign of laziness. \\n Let's assume, for a moment, that I was writing a novel, which takes place in a world where everyone walks. Suddenly, the protagonist takes off flying. As an author, I would have to create a backstory, a believable explanation why the protagonist has ability unique to him. Lowry, however, does not bother with explanations. Acts are presented as a matter of fact, despite their pertinence to the advancement of the plot, and there is no justification. \\n The plot itself, if it can be called that, is rather shallow at best. Imagine, for a moment, a society where feelings are superficial, emotions are unnecessary, and a ruling body makes choices for the populace, which is unaware of the lack of reality, that ensure the smooth continuation of the utopia. Then, out of the blue, a boy with a power to see beyond (unexplained) is told that he was selected to carry the pain of memories for the entire community (again, no explanation why the regular citizens do not have memories, emotions, et cetera). The boy begins to receive memories, both painful and joyful, and mentions to his teacher that it would be better if all citizens had memories. The teacher agrees, but reasons that he has thought the same for ages, and could not find a way for it to happen. The teacher recalls an incident where an earlier apprentice quit and the memories transmitted to her escaped and entered the citizens. Suddenly, he and the boy realize that this is the way to enable the citizens to have memories, and they hatch a plan for the boy to escape the community so that, once he leaves, the memories he has will return and enter the population. Wow. Really? Ahem . . . boring. There are so many holes in this, and the author does not bother with any explanations. How are the memories contained within only one individual? How do the memories leave that individual and enter the population? How come the memories cannot leave the physical boundaries of the community but the individual can? Why does the 'giver' not leave himself do accomplish this? Why did it take him ages to figure this out? How come no one has done it before? \\n Okay, what am I, an idiot? \\n Thus, as a utopian/dystopian tale, this fails. \\n Some, however, view this as a coming of age story, since Jonas (the protagonist) has an awakening and finds his consciousness. Again, I cannot view this work seriously as a coming of age story, because the awakening is mediocre at best, and the required character arc is lacking. Jonas might have had an awakening, but it was nothing groundbreaking. It was more like: Oh, I have a power. Oh, I'm learning things. Hey, my father has been lying to me! Okay, this should stop. I'm outta here before they kill the baby, which recently entered my life. \\n The story had the potential to explore the disenchanted nature of the protagonist, the buildup and the excitement of discovering the truth, only to have the weight of the truth crush him. It had the potential to explore inner turmoil, the will to rise against injustice, deception, and the wrong rule. But it did not. It presented the tale in an arc that was rather flat. \\n The plot and characters aside, I found the writing somewhat dull. It lacked on many levels. \\n In conclusion, I must admit that I am, perhaps, more critical in my review than necessary. Nevertheless, in light of the countless glowing reviews posted on Goodreads by English Majors, educators, and readers, I feel it is my duty to be critical. When numerous books of higher literary merit are overlooked and virtually unknown, a book awarded the Newbery Medal should live up to the standards associated with that prestigious award. Looking back at it, I do not see why it was awarded. || 4.5/5 \\n This book was so good! I really enjoyed the premise of the book and how simple things, like color, were foreign to the people in this community. The ending was completely open-ended and I wish we got to know more about what happened. \\n I couldn't give it a 5/5 because I was a little bored after Jonas was given the assignment of the Receiver, but it was still a great read. || Reread this for the class im teaching. Loved it this time around as well. however, having read the Hunger Games series and then The Giver back to back, I find myself rather aware of the fact that the dominant race in these societies is, well, white. And the whole \"pale eyes\"=special thing in the Given has always rubbed me the wrong way (consider readers of color and consider how often this trope of \"pale eyes\" or \"blue eyes\"= special is used in YA literature, and the problem is obvious.). At least that's how it came across to me. I need to marinate on this. My issue is not with the books themselves, it's with the collective and lack of diversity within the collective. In other words, the usual problem. || The is, for me at least, the definitive in distopic literature. It's the measure to which I hold most other mg/ya sci fi. || Honestly I don't think I can write a full review for it. All in all it was good and it'd be amazing if I was 12-14 and reading dystopia for the first time. \\n Looking forward to the movie, though. || Do posledno se kolebakh kakvo tochno da napisha za \"Paziteliat\", zashchoto mnenieto mi za knigata e malko protivorechivo. \\n Naistina kharesakh osnovnata ideia na romana - antiutopichniiat sviat beshe dobre izgraden i imakh iasna kartina za zhivota na khorata v nego, miastoto na vseki edin ot tiakh, lishavaneto im ot svobodata na izbor, striktnite pravila i zabrani, koito triabvashe da spazvat...

Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher who is just a teacher. || Still five stars. Love this so much. Can't review. Couldn't even take notes. Watched the movie immediately after finishing. Need next book. Wish I lived in this world. Damn you, Rowling. || Buddy-read with two of my Great Escape gal pals- Stepheny and Ivonne. \\n Be on the look out for Stepheny Potthead aka The Book Pusher aka Quick Draw Stepheny aka The Nutty Professor. Last seen running along side the Knight Bus with Harry Potter's invisible cloak. Also Suspected in the kidnapping of fellow Goodreader Jeff and best-selling author Stephen King. Blonde Hair...big green doll eyes, has a frightening maniacal cackle and a tendency to whine when she doesn't get her way. LOUDLY. Considered armed and dangerous- approach with caution...and Nerds- she likes Nerds. \\n Now back to our regularly scheduled review.... \\n I don't listen to a lot of audio-books (I prefer to read) but I was kind of falling behind in my reading commitments...and I had put Ms. Stepheny off again and again for this buddy-read soooooo many times- I couldn't do it again to her (she pouts..and she gets all mopey and it is JUST heartbreaking). I am so happy I listened to this one- Stephen Fry was just perfect. Perfect!..and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was just the thing to put me in the Christmas Spirit. \\n It's Harry's least favorite time of year- school break spent with the Dursleys...and this visit isn't going well. First: News that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban- Second: An unfortunate accident involving mean Aunt Marge... \\n Harry decides not to stick around- and catches the Knight Bus to Diagon Alley- where instead of getting in trouble for using magic away from Hogwarts, he gets invited to stay until school begins, by Cornelius Fudge-the Minister for Magic. \\n The night before he is expected to leave- Harry is warned that Sirius may have escaped with murder in mind- and HE may be the target.... \\n This is my favorite of the series so far!! I loved that it was still light and fun...but that the darkness is slooooooooowly creeping in. \\n I loved that a lot of it took place during the Christmas Holidays... \\n I really liked the addition of the Dementors...spoooooky... \\n ...and I adored Buckbeak!! \\n As for the whereabouts of Stepheny? I can almost guarantee...she is up to no good. || Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home. \\n *I was feeling guilty okay?Seeing this in my currently reading shelf while in reality it was in standby mode. * \\n And there are Moony,Padfoot,Prongs and Wormtail (Sexy names) in Prisoner of Azkaban....So, the welcome home thing gets even better. \\n --Since my reading slump won't let me read or sleep ,I might as well try to knock some sense into mudblood people who still haven't picked up the perfection that is Harry Potter. Hey don't look at me accusing loathsome eyes, I'm not a racist just Slytherin. I'm supposed to say mean things like that.<< Gotta keep the stereotype and all. \\n So lets talk about HOW your unassuming life will change if you read this magical series; \\n De-friending not so innocent bystanders announcing \"Harry Potter is dumb\" or \"Harry Potter is for kids\" will become a common occurrence. Ask any potterhead, it happens a lot of times. \\n What is your Hogwarts house will become your idea of small talk. \\n You'll start saying Harry Potter cliches like\"I'm still waiting for my Hogwart's letter\", (probably) make random curse references (accio remote) and maybe start saying things like she is such a fake Harry Potter fan when someone doesn't know that Owlpost is the first chapter of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. \\n Umm you'll make a lot of new friends starting this way. \\n or maybe kicked out of class for calling a teacher Muggle who will unfortunately understand the reference, get offended and ban you from his class. I bet he was a Gryfinndor. \\n You''ll probably have a shrine of a lot of Harry Potter goodies. \\n Then try to convert the remaining unassuming people into Harry Potter fans. \\n Or become obsessive and say Harry Potter 50 times a day and get a award for reiteration.*thank you all* \\n P.S RIP Alan Rickman. We'll always remember your always and oily hair. \\n P.P.S OOO and even if you hate Malfoy in the books you'll have a---Lets call it a crush,for want of a better word. ON HIM. (Really) \\n And I'm not kidding with the next spoiler. It's anything but fake. || The third HP adventure serves to bring the likable Sirius Black into the story and get Gryffindor their Quidditch Cup, but the story and action was still far less gripping than the first novel. I thought that Lupin was an interesting character, but less spectacular than the previous two teachers against the Black Arts. I recall reading this for the first time nearly two decades ago when it came out and losing enthusiasm for the Harry Potter universe. However, I read it again so that I can read the rest with my son (he refused to read 2 and 3 with me because he felt they were the weakest books in the series and I have to say I agree with him). Nonetheless, one must read this story for the long game if one wishes to make sense of the rest. I am still a bit baffled by the whole switcheroo that Prang & Co did leading to the death of HP's father and mother, but perhaps they will return to that later. \\n On to The Goblet of Fire and the Quidditch World Cup! ||  || \"OMG -- Not another book review on Harry Potter.\" *or* \"OMG -- I LOVE HARRY POTTER\" \\n I bet you just said something along those lines... Me too. But I have to do this for two reasons: (1) It's Harry Potter and (2) I committed to writing a real review for every book I've read and I'm only on 202 of 454. Slap me please. But when I'm done, not quite yet. \\n However, to save us both... I won't do a review on this whole book. You can read every other review for that! I'll just say the top 5 reasons why I loved this particular book: \\n 1. Harry Potter went dark! Not the book... the character... this was the first time for me where I really stood back and said \"He's growing up. He's realizing not everything around him should be believed without a hint of doubt.\" When he protected Sirius in the Shrieking Shack, it all changed for me. \\n 2. Dementors are awesome. I love the concept of stealing someone's soul through sucking their physical body off its bones. \\n 3. Transfiguration is a focus point, and I love seeing people turn into animals. It's like our core is bursting to show itself. \\n 4. Remus was my favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He was someone I'd want to hang out with... you know, and be a werewolf and all. \\n 5. History is revealed in many family connections and secrets. And since that's my favorite thing... this book was the most eye-opening for me. \\n See, that wasn't so bad to re-read a little bit of Harry Potter. I promise the next one won't be so hard. Only 4 left to write a review for. \\n About Me \\n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find TV & Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world.

Thanks for stopping by. \\n [polldaddy poll=9729544] \\n [polldaddy poll=9719251] || I read this as a buddy read, but really I wanted to compare the text to the movies more than anything. I've watched them so much and I've only read the series once through. (Now twice through this third book.) \\n So what do I think about this monstrosity of a series that gets so many hearts a-pumpin? About this book in particular? \\n I love it. \\n But how about this book in comparison to the film, you ask? \\n ALAS! I like the movie better. \\n What??? Blasphemy! Heretic! \\n No no no, give me a chance. I liked the fact that Hermione develops real stressed-out reasons for giving up the time-turner even if the reasons are still rather weak, all told, when taken in conjunction with all the other crap that happens in the series later. It'll always be one of those hedge-moments for me. BUT, putting that aside, the actual narrative events that happen in the book that I think are the best parts, namely the space of a certain 3 hour stretch, BOTH times, was much more fascinating and fleshed out in the movie. \\n Sorry! It's true! All the expressions and the little tidbits and quirks were more brilliant on the screen. And so was the penultimate event that always... ALWAYS brings tears to my eyes... the moment when Harry realizes that he was the one to bring out that awesome power to save himself. Even now I tear up when I think about it. \\n Yes, the book has it, but the build up was just too quick in the text. The movie, however, did what movies are brilliant at.... SHOWING us the enormity of the event. Sometimes it just takes the right media. \\n The movie is my favorite of the series. I'm reserving judgement as to whether the book is as well. (At least until I finish my re-read. :) || Is there any way to write a review on any of the Harry Potter books without doing it injustice? Nearly nobody attempts to create a full review on this series because of 1) its popularity, 2) its huge fanbase and 3) its awesomeness in general. And neither will I do so. The first book was fantastic, although I read it probably ten years too late in my life. The second book was not so fantastic, but still a great book. And the third one ... completely blew my mind. \\n I wanted to write a review on this book; I even started a checklist to keep track of what I wanted to add here. But the further I delved into the stories about the Prisoner of Azkaban, the more did I realize that the only things I was going to say were 'X is awesome', 'Y rocks' and 'Z simply has to be the winner'. The only aspect which might be criticized about this book might be the fact that some characters like Voldemort, Malfoy or, on the other hand, Harry, Hermione or Ron are relatively black or white, evil or good. But I don't mind. Because. Those. Characters. Are. Amazing. Hagrid and Lupin are my new favorites after reading this book. And I want more of Hedwig, because - owls! \\n In contrast to the two previous books, the pace is so wonderfully matching in this book. Just at the right time before the descriptions of the Hogwarts school year (all of them contributing to the entire plot) might turn too extensive, the story climbs up to its climax and concludes within one hundred pages of incredible tension. Logical relevations, long-desired confrontations and a lot of surprises will accompany you during your journey with Harry and his friends, resulting in the convergence of several different plotlines which were established during the course of the novel. \\n Most of the people I know have read this book, but if you happen to be one of the few exceptions, then go read it. Maybe you fear it because of its fantasy elements? I've never been a fan of fantasy either, but this book series changed my opinion. Maybe you fear it because of its popularity? Don't be afraid. The hype is completely justified. \\n My reviews in the Harry Potter series: \\n 1) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: Go to review \\n 2) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: Go to review || Shit got real! \\n For me, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was when the series got exciting! It certainly got darker and more mature. Torture, loss, a foreboding sense of dread and death itself descended upon this happy little world of magic where school exams and difficult professors were the worst things to worry about until recently. \\n I'm a big fan of the tone. The series jumps right into its bigboy pants here. As an adult reading these books, I was glad to see the maturity. Yeah, it's still YA and not targeted towards me, but at least now it felt a little closer to something in my old man range. \\n As mentioned before, there's an ever present element of death in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Those ghoulish dementors are death itself. However, it also introduced a reason for Harry to want to live: his godfather, a connection to his parents. Up until then there was little joy in Harry's life. Sure there was the school, but that would end soon enough. Rowling did a smart thing when she introduced Sirius Black, she gave Harry a human bond and something to lose. As readers our attachment grew with his. That was when Harry became real to me. || Re-read 2015 - 5 always magical stars \\n Let's not talk about how Sirius kept his sanity (most of it anyway) in Azkaban to avenge his best friends. \\n Or how he asked Harry to stay with him for the summer \\n And the thing that happened in the later books... \\n Let's not... || 5 STARS!!! \\n My Favorite book and movie in the HP series!! I loved diving back into this world and reading about Sirius and Remus again and how dark this one was. I will be rewatching the movie this week coming up on Twitter(@RichardBookNook), I'll be live-tweeting so look out for that. Next month I will do my best to read Goblet of Fire, it's a chunker so I hope it works out. haha - Richard || Hey, Jo? || Perfection again. Re-reading this series is making me SO happy. Except that this book is where things start getting really gloomy and it just breaks my heart to see bad things happening to lil Harry :c || khdy! wn dwrh chqdr hyjn dshtym w chqdr ldht my brdym z khwndn yn mjmw`h. shyd ykhy z bhtryn tjrbh hy khtbkhwny `mrm bshh.

None of us have read or finished the Harry Potter series, and as teachers it is about time we read one of the most popular YA book series. \\n This book starts off like the other two Harry Potter books. Harry is at his Aunt and Uncle's place and gets rescued from their evil ways and makes his way to the wizarding world. This book has a similar pattern to the other books. Harry is involved in Quidditch and in every game he faces challenges from the outside. He also has a villain in this book that is not Lord V. Black is a murderer escaped from Azkaban and is being pursued by the soul-sucking Dementors who guarded him in prison. \\n Harry faces multiple challenges and problems and overcomes them with greatness. These books are decently predictable, but J.K. Rowling's fantastic writing makes up for it. || I just really really love Remus Lupin okay || I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. \\n These book really never get old. No matter how many times I read them (and I read them a lot). I love the time turner part of the book and watching them watch themselves going through everything. Love love love Sirius and Remus and this is when the overall story really starts to get going! || 4.5 \\n My favorite Harry Potter so far. The cast of characters and world really expanded in this one and there were some moments of brilliance. My one complaint was the pacing, as something great would happen and then there'd be long stretches of time without much plot development. I still don't feel like I'm aboard the HP fandom train but I think I might be getting there. Also psyched I finally know what the Marauders Map is. || Yep, still my favourite.   \n",

                                                                                          Loved this book so much! \\n I loved Auggie. \\n Cant wait to see the film || My former high school librarian recommended this book to me when it came out. I should have read it then. Always trust a librarian. \\n This is an impossible book to dislike. It's so full of human emotions - kindness, love, courage, determination, fear - and so full of beautiful messages. \\n August Pullman is a wonderful boy. Not retarded. He functions normally and is pretty smart. But he is facially deformed, which makes it psychologically challenging for him to go out, let alone attend school. \\n But his mom thinks it's time for him to stop being homeschooled. At school, he makes friends who help him feel like he belongs and enemies who remind him that he will never be a normal kid. Auggie wishes to show people that there is more to him than his appearance, but not everyone is receptive. \\n Told from various point of views in a very truthful and heartfelt manner, this story celebrates differences and proves that the human being is more good than bad. \\n Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin' || Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/ \\n \"O, I believe \\n Fate smiled and destiny \\n Laughed as she came to my cradle \\n Know this child will be able \\n Laughed as she came to my mother \\n Know this child will not suffer \\n Laughed as my body she lifted \\n Know this child will be gifted \\n With love, with patience and with faith \\n He'll make his way\" \\n For anyone who even is thinking about saying this is a kid's book . . . . \\n And also you are wrong. Wonder is a book for EVERYONE. Seriously. Like every single human being on the entire planet. And maybe even your dog. Hands down the best Middle-Grade book I've ever read. So much so that I just did a re-read and I never do a re-read. \\n This is the story of August Pullman and his experiences during 5th grade - which just so happens to be the first year he ever attended school after being homeschooled. Why was Auggie homeschooled???? Well . . . \\n \"Rat boy. Freak. Freddy Krueger, E.T. Gross-out. Lizard face. Mutant. I know the names they call me. I've been in enough playgrounds to know kids can be mean. I know, I know, I know.\" \\n Fifth grade is the year that Auggie's parents decide they need to attempt to expose him to the real world. They realize that reality for Auggie might be harsh and offer him the opportunity to go back to homeschooling at any time, but remain hopeful that people will look past Auggie's exterior and see the exceptional person he really is. \\n A little backstory: Awhile back it came to my attention that my youngest child was claiming to be doing his required reading, but really was . . . well, pretty much just staring off into space and doing anything except reading. (He is my child so you have to figure there's some buttholery that rears its ugly head every now and again.) The easiest solution to the problem? Buddy read with dear ol' mom. So I forced him to read my favorite \"kid book\" and guess what happened????? \\n He started flagging quotes just like his nutcase mother . . . \\n Know what else? It really kind of kicks all the butt to have \"book club\" with a small human. We'd read 20 pages a day (the required amount - unfortunately I'm not a miracle worker so he still doesn't loooooooooove the process of reading like I do) and then drink hot cocoa and talk about what we read (to confirm he really was reading this time and not pretending). Sometimes we would share tears and sometimes we would share laughs. We always shared the importance of being a \"Jack\" rather than being a \"Julian.\" \\n Small humans final reaction? \"PHENOMENAL. 5 Stars. Every kid should read this and we should read books like this in class instead of the boring stuff they make us read.\" \\n My reaction????? \\n This book will break your heart . . . but then it will put the pieces back together again. Filled with lessons of being a decent person that it teaches in the best, most non-preachy way possible. Bottom line is it is just . . . \\n Have you seen Hot Rod? It's kind of the worst movie ever while simultaneously being the best movie ever. My kid is a freaky movie quoter like his mother and encouraged me to overshare this gif. If you read the book you'll see it makes sense. What are you waiting for? Go read it right now. Here, I'll even help you with the supplies you'll need before starting . . . \\n I bought a hardback of this book because it is seriously one of the best things I've ever read. I look forward to forcing my future grandchildren to experience all of its Wonder just like I did to their daddy. || Really great story about bullying and what it's like to be different in the mean world of middle school. My only issue is there wasn't much of a plot and I found it slow at times but I think that may be because it's middle grade. I guess I just would've liked a more cohesive story line. || I'm not kidding when I say every single person from 10 years to adults should read this book. The blurb made it sound special, but how special I had no idea. I can tell you now it is one of the most special stories I have ever read. \\n August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a genetic defect that changed his face. He and his family are perfectly aware of the attention he attracts, and the decision to send him to 'outside school' for the first time in Grade 5 was not taken lightly. This is the story of Auggie's life through middle school, and it is an unbelievably inspiring, life-changing journey. \\n The narrative is told from different points of view, which makes the story more real for all kinds of readers. Not everyone sees Auggie in the same light, and each has their own way of coming to understand and love him. Via has been through a lot as August's elder sister, and though she's one of the most generous, loving sisters ever, the pressures of high school are taking their toll. But for her brief moments of weakness she more than makes up with a determination to start over that makes this story inspiring and relevant for every teen. Justin, Via's new boyfriend, is an easy-going, down to earth character, yet somehow his simplicity allows him to perceive things at a deeper level than most. I love his thoughts about whether 'the universe' was really unkind to Auggie Pullman, and his conclusion is perfect. That page titled 'The Universe' would make a profound stimulant for discussion. Summer is one of those extraordinary kids who observe with their heart and are not afraid to act. Jack is every kid who has cause to regret a friendship bungle, and who, in the process, learns so much about the kind of person he wants to be. Miranda, Via's old friend, perhaps has it hardest of them all, and her difficulties seem set to ruin her life. Yet she is one of the few who have always seen Auggie as the wonder he truly is, and because of him she finds her way home. \\n Others' points of view are interspersed with Auggie's own, and it's beautiful to see his character grow: what a transformation from the beginning to the end; what a lot he has to go through. Initially he shows us an excusable frustration with his condition and people's reaction to it, and his middle childhood growing pains are so much more acute than those of others. Like Via says, \"My worst day, worst fall, worst headache, worst bruise, worst cramp, worst mean thing anyone could say has always been nothing compared to what August has gone through.\" But more than this, we see the strength of his loving family which nurtures in him the qualities that make him so special: courage, kindness, friendship, character, helping him become someone truly great, someone \"whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.\" Those last few chapters which include Mr Tushman's speech would make another inspiring discussion. \\n Somehow the genuineness of Auggie's situation naturalises all the advice the reader is given. There are references to all of my favourite books: The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, my favourite line from Shakespeare's Hamlet, and one of the most profound quotes from Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and all the quotes are meaningfully connected with the characters. I won't spoil the power they have in the story by relaying them here, you just have to read it. And then there are Mr Browne's 'precepts' which are a kind of motto for his class to follow each month, another great idea that is subtle but so effective, you'll want to memorise the full list at the end. \\n After reading the book I wanted to find out more about the author. Who is the person who can write something like this? What I learned from her blog only made me love the book more. Her last note of thanks went to \"the little girl in front of the ice cream shop and all the other \"Auggies,\" whose stories have inspired me to write this book.\" She said that there were passages where she cried while writing it, and gives a moving account of reading it to her own son. This is a person I would like to know. www.GoodReadingGuide.com \\n \"That's how it is in heaven. It's just love, and no one forgets who they love.\" \\n \"Do people look the same when they go to heaven, mommy?\" \\n \"I don't know. I don't think so.\" \\n \"Then how do people recognize each other?\" \\n \"I don't know, sweetie. They just feel it. You don't need your eyes to love, right?\" \\n \"no, no, it's not all random, if it really was all random, the universe would abandon us completely. and the universe doesn't. it takes care of its most fragile creations in ways we can't see. like with parents who adore you blindly. and a big sister who feels guilty for being human over you. and a little gravelly-voiced kid whose friends have left him over you. and even a pink-haired girl who carries your picture in her wallet. maybe it is a lottery, but the universe makes it all even out in the end. the universe takes care of all its birds.\" \\n \"The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.\" \\n \"...your deeds are like your monuments. Built with memories instead of stone.\" || \"Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed.\" \\n This is the kind of story that should be read by everyone, from children to adults because it teaches many valuable lessons, and most importantly it shows us what it's like to be in someone else's shoes. \\n The storyoif Auggie is different because he's simply different, we witness his experience in life and also the experience of the people around him, from family to school mates. So we got to read the story from different POV, the chapters are also very short and keep changing between characters which made this easy and fun to read. \\n This story was packed with so many emotions, I nearly cried at some parts and laughed at others, \\n The writing was beautiful and fun, i finished this so fast and could not put it down, i never got bored and always wanted to have more. I rarely enjoy realistic stories but this one is brilliant and fun. \\n And I will always try to remember to be kinder, because being just kind is not enough. || 4 Stars \\n Overview: \\n \"When given the choice between being right and being kind, choose kind.\" \\n I don't read a lot of middle-grade, but this broached an assortment of complicated topics with more sensitivity than most 'adult' books and really surprised me. \\n The main character, August was born with a facial abnormality that not only resulted in dozens of surgeries, but prevented him from attending school until 5th grade. This story revolves around his first year at his new school. \\n Pros: \\n The narrators range in from 10 year-olds to highschool-students and the voices reflect this. The kids sounded like kids. The teenagers sounded like teenagers. Everyone had a distinct voice that wasn't limited by age. \\n The message here is important. I strongly believe this book would be a great gift for a child around August's age, because it opens all sorts of conversations about empathy. It encourages them to think about the ramifications of their actions and the way they view each other, without being overwhelming or needlessly dark. \\n Via's story was my favorite and I wasn't expecting the switch to her POV, but I'm so glad it was there. It's easy to get wrapped up in August's story and how it affects him daily--but R. J. Palacio doesn't let you forget it's the same for his family. This was a more complicated approach than I expected from this book, and I think it was handled with care. \\n I appreciated that August's classmates were of all different races, socioeconomic backgrounds and religions. \\n August was a very precious and loving kid, and it was incredibly easy to root for him. \\n Cons: \\n Probably because I don't read a lot of middle-grade, I didn't fully connect with this the way someone younger (or more willing to enter that mind-set) might have. This story is very wholesome and upbeat, and looking through cynical-adult glasses, I couldn't help but feel it lost realism because of it. \\n Via's boyfriend has his own POV... told without punctuation or capitalization? It was incredibly frustrating to read and actually made his chapters harder to understand. I couldn't understand why Palacio decided to do this, until I found this quote from her website: \\n \"I remember thinking back then, especially when I would get into the really low notes, that notes on a musical staff looked a little like lowercase letters of the alphabet...Maybe it's because I've been a graphic designer for so many years, but I'm trained to see typefaces and fonts not just as communication devices, but as visual cues for other things. So when it came to writing from Justin's point of view, because he's a musician, someone who thinks in musical terms, it just seemed natural for me to use lowercase letters to represent his thoughts in a very visual way. He's the kind of person who doesn't talk a lot, because he's naturally shy, but has a lot going on inside. The running monologue inside his head has no time for capital letters or punctuation: it's like his thoughts are streaming inside his mind. \\n ...so I understand. But personally, I still didn't like it. I think there were better ways of communicating Justin's character without font-tricks. \\n I'm totally nit-picking here, but why did everyone talk about 5th grade being the first year of middle school? Because where I'm from, middle school is grades six through eight and 5th is still elementary. \\n In Conclusion: \\n A sweet Middle-Grade story that showcases the importance of empathy through a diverse cast of characters and one adorable little boy. || I don't know how to describe this book. It has so much power in it. I think everyone should read it and maybe,just maybe, the world would be a better and kinder place. \\n This is a heart-felt book,so much meaning into it. Its about being different,being kind to the people who are different,its also about family,friendships and its just all the was amazing. I cried so much while reading this BUT i also laughed a lot. Its not a 'omg this is so sad' book,its a 'that's the world,it may be ugly sometimes but its also really really GREAT.' kind of book. I seriously laughed out loud while reading this and i was in public so people thought i was crazy xD \\n I loved so many parts of it,where do i even begin? The POVs were perfection. I loved how each character got a different kind of writing and expressing themselves,because we're ALL different and its beautiful. I also loved how it was so honest. His sister loving him but also sometimes feeling guilty about the way the world or herself was thinking. Jack,trying to figure things out. Auggie being this funny,sarcastic,brave little boy. I just LOVE him afijailf *FEELS* :') And don't even get me started on the Julian chapter. Such a powerful piece. WOW. This book should win all the awards. Seriously. It needs a standing ovation. || \"Some things you just can't explain. You don't even try. You don't know where to start. All your sentences would jumble up like a giant knot if you opened your mouth. Any words you used would come out wrong.\" \\n This is exactly how I feel as I sit here trying to come up with the words to explain this book and how it made me feel. I'm going to give it my best. \\n Kids can be cruel. Kids can be surprisingly empathetic. That's a part of what this book is about. \\n Auggie Pullman was born with a one in a million(s) facial defect. The kind of defect that startles the unsuspecting, the kind of defect that will stop a person dead in their tracks, and at 10 years of age Auggie decides to go to a real school. \\n It was called Junior High in my day and that started in the 7th grade. Today it's called Middle school and it starts in the 5th grade. According to my dusty memory, this time in a kid's life can suck even if you have a normal face, so for Auggie this year has the potential to be much worse. \\n When he was born he was not expected to live, but he did. Through the years of his young life he had many surgeries to make his face functional. He was home schooled until fifth grade when he and his family decided it was time to go to a real school. As you would expect, he had a hard time winning friends.....kids are shallow. But the friends he won early on were keepers, because they went against the stream when they became his friend. \\n The year had many tough moments for Auggie and many great ones. Told by six different voices, telling the story of the year and of Auggie's life, from each of their perspectives, and it was done brilliantly. It could have become confused and messy very easily, but it was spot on. This book is a little, sparkly, gem. \\n \"The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.\" || Everyone seems to love this book all over the place - apparently for very convincing reasons, as it deals with what a deformed little boy has to go through in school when his new classmates are confronted with his face for the first time. This is a book about bullying, but also about hope, friendship and family. And it's a good book, featuring a believable and interesting protagonist you simply can't help but relate to. \\n August ,,Auggie\" Pullman has been born with a cleft palate which left him with a facial deformation, influencing his hearing abilities and scaring a lot of the people he meets away. After being homeschooled for quite some years, at the age of ten, Auggie's parents finally decide to allow him to enter middle school - leading Auggie into the beginning of a new chapter in his life, a chapter in which he is going to be confronted with friendship and the darkest sides of bullying alike. Entering this novel, I didn't know that cleft palates occure in 1 to 2 per 1000 births in the developed world - the subject of the novel is certainly a very strong and important one, a subject people should be confronted with because, after all, there is still too much bullying in this world. \\n Palacio structured her book in a very interesting way by including the viewpoints of several characters. After allowing the reader to get used to Auggie's voice, we meet his sister Via, then one of Auggie's friends at school, Summer, afterwards another classmate called Jack, then Via's boyfriend and finally an old friend of Via, Miranda. All of them were characterized by unique voices ... a method I didn't approve of at all. Why does an author need to write entire chapters without capitalization and in fragmented sentences just to underline that the character doesn't seem to care about grammar and how to express oneself properly? It was annoying and a struggle to read, as were the Facebook chat messages between two characters, which mainly consisted of messages like ,,can we b frenz agen?\" or ,,awsum!!!!\" by characters who talk in their own point of view chapters sophisticated enough to appear capable of using the English language without butchering it. It is simply contradictory when the author writes about one character in his very own punctuation, but then writes inconsistently about the voices of others. \\n If you don't want to be spoiled about the ending, then please don't read the parts I marked as such. Don't say I didn't warn you. \\n The ending is happier than a novel with such a dark and depressing topic should be allowed to be. Reminiscent of successful movies like ,,Shawshank Redemption\", this tale dealt with serious topics and then allowed the topic hope to take over the style of the story. But in comparison with Shawshank, ,,Wonder\" didn't conclude on a bitter-sweet and realistic note, it simply cried out ,,Here is your happy ending!\" and ,,Be happy about it!\" I did care for Auggie and was happy to realize that in the ending he had his own touching and amazing moments. But it took away a lot of the realistic aspects from the beginning, because when does a story actually end on such a happy note in real life? Remember that this is simply my personal opinion, but I thought that a more subtile conclusion would have been more memorable. The way it was written, this simply appeared to be like another school drama, even in spite of all the serious topics which were attached in the beginning and the middle part. \\n Some time after the release of Wonder, R.J. Palacio published another chapter with the point of view of Julian, one of the kids who bullied Auggie in school. Not even Goodreads seems to know how to deal with this story, as there is one edition of Wonder with more than 160,000 ratings (the one I am reviewing right now) and then another edition with 110,000 ratings which includes the ten pages from the Julian chapter. Until a few weeks ago, those two editions were combined in a single book, yet now they have been divided into two different books on GR - which is confusing as hell. (Edit: As of October 2016, the two editions are combined as one single edition again.) Anyway, I gave the other edition two stars because of the way Palacio tried (and for me, obviously, failed) to excuse bullying. Julian was revealed to have suffered from nightmares about scary faces in his childhood, which made him feel like Auggie is just another monster - thus his awful behavior towards him. I don't doubt that something like this might happen in real life, just as, after all, there is no excuse for bullying. It was the way Palacio sounded as if this was to redeem Julian's character which confused me and ultimately made me feel like having some negative experiences in one's childhood makes up for plaguing someone who isn't even responsible for the way he looks. \\n This is a book loved by almost everyone, and they are all right. Believe them. I'm just this weird reader who almost never likes those books which have received all the attention in the universe. \\n Buddy Read with Anne. Click here for her review. || Original post at One More Page \\n There was a time a few years ago when I was hearing mass with my family, and I happened to stand beside this man at church. The man wasn't dressed the way other people were dressed during Sunday mass. He looked scruffy, almost like he came straight from the streets to the church. He didn't look dangerous, and perhaps he even is nice given that he was in church and all. But what I really noticed were his hands. They were, if I were to be perfectly honest, kind of scary. The memory's vague, but I remember that it looked like he had some kind of skin disease -- lesions, wounds and spots -- the kind that one would refuse to touch in fear of contagion. I was afraid to touch it, knowing especially that at a certain part of the mass, I would have to hold his hand while praying The Lord's Prayer. \\n I tried, I really did. I was in church, and holding hands with a stranger during a prayer is the thing to do. It was the good thing, the kind thing, the loving thing. It was expected. I told myself that I would do it, that I would hold his hand during The Lord's Prayer and not be scared or repulsed or look for a hand sanitizer after the prayer. I told myself, I prepared myself and I wanted to do it. \\n But I didn't. When the priest told everyone to \"join hands and as one family pray the prayer Jesus had taught us,\" I chickened out, opened my hand but did not take his, looked ahead and prayed, feeling the guilt grow heavier as the mass went on. \\n This particular memory may seem insignificant and well, I may be blowing things out of proportion. Perhaps the man never even noticed me at all -- but it struck me because I really wanted to do the kind thing, but I didn't because I was afraid. Just like how the other kids and grown ups in the book reacted to Auggie in Wonder by R.J. Palacio. August Pullman was born with a facial deformity that made him quite special to his family for his need of extra care. He has never attended a normal school, until he agreed with his parents to start attending fifth grade at Beecher Prep. Auggie is a perfect fit for the school, except maybe for his face. Told in Auggie's point of view as well as five more from the people around him, we follow Auggie as he faces one of the most challenging times of his young life. \\n I was prepared for a barrage of emotions that Wonder could probably give me, after reading several reviews and updates from Goodreads friends about this book. I knew that I was probably going to like it, but what I wasn't prepared for were what kind of emotions it would bring. Being a middle grade book, the writing was pretty simple and easy to read, especially since most of the narrators were kids as well. Wonder is bound to remind readers of their own middle school (or in my case, late elementary years, since we do not have middle school in the Philippines) experiences. It's strange to think of it, but young people can be very mean, even if it's not on purpose, and Wonder shows how it could be. My heart went out for Auggie, especially since he did not ask to look like the way he does. Like his parents, I wanted the best for him too. \\n The story was told not just in Auggie's point of view, but also with five other kids who surrounded Auggie's life. This made the book a little easier to relate to because let's admit it: most of us don't have what Auggie has. Of all the characters, I identified the most with his friend, Jack. I really wish I could be like Summer, that I could choose to be kind before anything else. I think Jack represents the side of everyone who tries to be good but fails, and then tries again anyway. And I think the trying is the most important part of it all. \\n There's a lot of buzz with what Wonder teaches, or attempts to teach, but I think maybe we shouldn't over think it too much. Sure, there are some parts that may seem a little simple, that the ending may seem to be a little too nicely wrapped up, almost like how a movie is done and we know real life is never that way. I see it as a simple thing: I see Wonder as a middle grade book that teaches kindness -- to quote, \"...to be kinder than necessary.\" That as human beings, we do not just have \"...the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness...\" and to choose that even when it's not easy, when it's inconvenient, even when it's uncomfortable. \\n Even though reading Wonder reminded me of that particular incident I shared at the start of this review which brought back some of the guilty feelings, this book made me feel a lot better after reading it. A little bit more whole, even. With a stronger resolve to be kinder than necessary. I think that a book that can make its readers feel like that is worth a second glance. || 'Sometimes I think my head is so big because it is so full of dreams'. \\n Wonderful 5 stars ***** \\n Before I say anything else, let me confess, I Ammara Abid, wholeheartedly love this book. \\n A big hand for R.J. Palacio for such an excellent write-up. This book hit me, it hit me hard. I can't explain in words the effect of 'Wonder' on me. I was completely awestruck. \\n I know it's a fiction but what an inspiring fiction it is! \\n Based on the bitter reality of our society and aspired from a little incident in real life. \\n It would urge you to stop and look around, \\n It would urge you to feel, \\n It would urge you to think, \\n to think about the special kids, \\n It would urge you to \\n 'Be HUMAN' \\n & \\n 'Be HUMANE'. \\n Most of the time tears rolling down my cheeks and yet no time to stop. The story is so moving, touching and gripping it grab your attention. There's no way out. You can't put it down. You can't. That's it. \\n Auggie 'the wonder boy' the main character of the book, the story revolves around it but what makes it more amazing is the narration. Not only narrated by Auggie but Via, Summer, Justin, Jack & Miranda too. \\n In the end when the Mr. Tushman announced the final award, Henry Ward Beecher medal, not only his friends cried out loud but me too with tears in my eyes and smile on my face \\n 'a happy crying' :\") \\n I love all the characters and their perspectives. The way story is being told is cherry on the top. \\n Precisely, this book stole my heart. I love it's title too I love everything about it. \\n Do you want some wonderful read? \\n 'Wonder' is your book to hold. \\n Unstoppably amazing \\n \"Surprise is one of those emotions that can be hard to fake, though, whether you're trying to look surprised when you're not or trying to not look surprised when you are.\" \\n My heart weep :'( \\n \"Do people go out of their way to avoid touching you, Via?\" he answered, which left me momentarily without an answer. \"Yeah, right. That's what I thought. So don't compare your bad days at school to mine, okay?\" \\n Modesty :\") \\n \"The main thing I have is this thing called man-di-bu-lo-facial dys-os-tosis--which took me forever to learn how to pronounce, by the way.\" || Incredible, touching book! A MUST read! || I went a bit kicking and screaming into the reading of this one because I thought --- yet another soppy sad story of a kid with a serious problem. Not to mention realistic school stories too often feel forced to this veteran classroom teacher. But as I read further into it I was completely taken in. This is a truly lovely story and beautifully, beautifully told. The movement between different characters' points of view is nicely done. The children and adults all seem real as can be, not a one seemed a straw man or someone pontificating a moral. There were moments when I was brought to tears, but they were genuine moments, not a one felt overly sacharine or manipulative. Nothing, in fact, is the slightest bit manipulative in this book. \\n Nicely done indeed. || 'Wonder' is a great book and a good story well told, aimed squarely at the 'young adult' market. Like many other great novels - due to its strength however, it transcends and easily surpasses the confines of its genre and limited target market. The characters are well developed and not stereotyped, the plot line well-constructed - nice character illustrations too. \\n The main character Auggie has a condition - a rare medical facial deformity (variously described as a facial anomaly, craniofacial difference, mandibulofacial dysostosis) and whilst this is central to the story, on another level that particular issue is almost incidental. This is a story about growing up; it's about being different, lunchbreak and classroom politics. It's about self-acceptance against all the odds, it's about perceived 'otherness' and the consequential bullying. So when I say that Augusts' facial anomaly is almost incidental, what I am trying to say is that this perceived otherness and the associated challenges as a theme for the novel could have been one of many things chosen from a sadly all too long list encompassing so many other aspects including - race, gender, size, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, religion, culture, nationality... \\n The message from this story - being that growing up is hard and that otherness or being 'different' can make things much harder. An important issue also raised here is concerning 'deformity' being misunderstood and wrongly equated with disability or 'special needs'. Often and as in this instance - Auggie has no disability and no 'special needs'. \\n This is an important and thought provoking story. Palacio tells us that 'Wonder' is a \"meditation on kindness - on the impact and transformative power of kindness\". 'Wonder' is a moving and uplifting story of kindness and acceptance - sadly though there will be many out there in life that aren't so lucky and so subject to both. For me though, ultimately and overall - 'Wonder' is about hope, faith in humanity and faith in the human spirit - there is good in us. Leaving us with the simple but obvious and important message that - it's not what you're like on the outside, but you're like on the inside and how you behave that counts. \\n When considering the current political climate on the world stage, where those with perceived 'differences' or otherness are all too often, far from being embraced - but on the contrary are being marginalised and demonised - to me this makes this kind of story is all the more important. \\n I will finish with two of Mr Browne's precepts: \\n 'When given the choice between being right and being kind - choose kind' \\n 'Be kinder than is necessary' \\n A random precept that has always stayed with me: \\n 'Never judge a man until you've walked a mile in his moccasins' \\n And one of my own: \\n 'Everyone is different, everyone is the same, different but equal' || Beautiful reminder of this book which I found on the internet. I just had to share it. \\n Wonder \\n was undoubtedly a memorably read. Between the narrative and the narrative structure and the book's message, it could very well have been phenomenal for me. But it wasn't. It felt to me like a great piece of art with lots of nice parts that didn't fit together enough to merge into one great piece of absolute beauty. Well, something like this. I love that the narrative bounced between characters, allowing us to see what it was like, not just for Auggie, but for all the people affected by Auggie's facial abnormality - even though I appreciated some narratives more than others. It was important to read about the perspectives of some of the people directly and indirectly influenced by him. I definitely loved the themes that inspire one to exercise simple human virtues like patience and kindness. The contrast made between middle school and high school life as Auggie and his sister, Via, try to fit in their respective schools was also something of notability. It's clear that abnormality or not, it's tough trying to fit in and belong in both worlds. School - High, low or middle - can feel like a religion or culture. Or worse, both. \\n I relive moments from this book and it makes me really appreciate the importance of true beauty and human goodness and those who are strong enough to attain it. True beauty is earned, we have to fight everyday to be beautiful inside and I cringe at how easy it is to be the opposite - ugly and cruel. That's one of the finest morals of this story. \\n My biggest problem with the story was the ending was too glassy, too blindly bright and shiny. Too squeaky clean - and dare I say it turned plastic. But(and this is a humongous BUT) like I said, I believe the true beauty of the story lies in the boy behind it - again even if some characters would have been more reader friendly if they had been a little more developed and more interesting in their narratives. All in all, this was a fairly good read. To read Fabian's review, please click here || Auggie Pullman is born with Treacher Collins, a chromosome disorder that results in severe facial deformities. He is homeschooled for many years because of his ongoing need for extensive surgery and his parents' fear about how Auggie will be treated. \\n When Auggie begins fifth grade, his parents decide to send him to school. How Auggie, his family, and his classmates deal with Auggie's transition to school during one school year forms the basis of the storyline. I appreciated the honesty of his situation and how other children respond to Auggie at school. Many kids tease Auggie and the author also shows how Auggie is excluded without being openly bullied. \\n Wonder is a remarkable book about courage, love, and the difference one person can make in the lives of others. Auggie is an inspiring person because he is just an ordinary kid. It isn't just Auggie who inspires you, though, his parents, older sister, his teachers, and his friends and their families show their strength and love for Auggie in their daily interactions with him. \\n While the ending was a little bit like a Hallmark movie, I thought it was appropriate to the mood of the story and the characters' actions. \\n You will cry and smile and think of the special people in your life. Wonder is the sort of book that stays with you. || Great story - felt so very real. Also, I thought I knew what to expect after the first 50 pages or so, but it definitely moved in a variety of different directions throughout. Highly recommend to just about anyone. || I promise I'm not heartless, but I didn't love this book. It wasn't just me either. I buddy read Wonder with my son and he wanted to DNF. It was required summer reading so no such luck for him. Our favorite parts were the precepts at the end. I'm fully aware that our experience is in a crazy minority for this title but that's how it goes sometimes. Neither one of us felt engaged or connected with the characters at any time in this story. We tried though. We took a lot of breaks, discussed the book as it progressed, brainstormed precepts of our own...it just wasn't happening. We wanted this book to be over. Regardless, I would still recommend Wonder to others, because like I said, our experience appears to be rare and the morals of this story are invaluable for every age. You're never too old to practice kindness or to re-evaluate how success is really measured. This book may have sucked for us but the life lessons made it worth it. Two stars instead of one :) \\n Note: The audio narration for Auggie's voice is awful in our opinion. Just because a person may have facial abnormalities does not mean their voice will be equally impaired. I found the narration insulting to Auggie's character and frankly it was grating to listen to based on my personal reading experience. It's hard to say if we would have enjoyed Wonder a bit more if we read it off the page instead. I thought this element was worth noting. \\n My favorite quote: \\n \"Isn't that the most important thing of all? Isn't that the kind of question we should be asking ourselves all the time? What kind of person am I?\" \\n 6/20/16: \\n Buddy read with my boy || my heart is so so so so so so so so so full   \n",

It practically begs the reader to come to the conclusion that if you don't \"get it\", it's your own fault because you're a \"grown up, and only kids can see what matters\". The truth is, there's nothing to get. It's heavy handed, clumsily executed observations on what's important in life. It's not wrong by any means, but it's the kind of pseudo-intellectual detritus that \\n freshmen philosophy majors will discuss as they pass the joint. \\n I'm going to go with a literal interpretation of the plot, because why the hell not: \\n A man crashes his plane in the desert, hallucinates a small alien boy that teaches him philosophical lessons, invents a history for him, finds a well just in time to stave off dehydration, as he re-hydrates, his hallucinated alien friend kills himself and disappears, he fixes his plane and flies home and is sad about it, but feels blessed for the experience as it has changed him. \\n Ready for the moral? It's really simple: \\n \"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\" Or in other words, spend your time developing relationships, don't worry so much about the things, they're not important, it's the time you spend and how you spend it that is. \\n That's a nice philosophy, I get it, but this book is silly. || Written as a children's book, I find myself unable to pin down firmly as to what makes The Little Prince such a universally likeable book, be it children or grown-ups. What makes it the Hotel California of literature? \\n Is it because most grown-ups secretly love being treated like kids? I think as a grown-up you ought to know better than that. Grown-ups like to be petted around now and then in jest, but that's the end of it. Often, when grown-ups are indeed treated like kids and they're not in the mood, there is a tiny matchstick inside each one of them, an insecure ego which flares up angrily like it has been wildly struck against a matchbox. In my experience, grown ups like to be taken very seriously. Very very seriously. \\n Is it the clear, simple language? No, it can't be just that. There have been books that have been written with clarity and have been criticized by pedants and pontificating bores for their simplicity. Grown ups like to feel wise and learned by having claimed to read complicated texts that engaged them at an 'intellectual' level. They don't like important things being pointed out to them in simple language, after all they're the know-it-all grown-ups and don't need anybody patronizing them. \\n Is it because the book is so short and grown-ups are always keen on finishing books real quick? No, it can't be just that either. I know grown-ups who believe that a good book, like a well-mixed drink, must be held between the fingers and tended to lovingly at length to let it get to your head. \\n Is it the timeless lessons that the book cushions behind layers of delightful story-telling? Is it the sense of wonder that the book inspires in the most cynical, world-weary adult, if not for posterity then for a day or an hour? I don't know, could be, could be. Worthy contenders they are, but I think I'm not still not home. \\n If I had to lay a bet on it, I'd say everyone adores The Little Prince because we are tired of meeting people from Earth everyday who speak the same dry language of numbers and would love to encounter a sunset-loving, wise prince from the room-sized planet of Asteroid B-612 who talks animatedly about butterflies, baobabs and volcanoes to the child inside us that we've buried long ago underneath the grey tomb of grown-up babble. \\n Kurt Vonnegut once expressed how laughable a critic taking himself too seriously is in these memorable words, \\n \"Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel is preposterous. He or she is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae.\" \\n That is exactly how ridiculous critics who despise The Little Prince are. For The Little Prince is that hot fudge sundae garnished with generous toppings of lost innocence, shared loneliness, deliciously recycled perspective and lessons worth repeating to yourself to keep from succumbing to the unsavoury, contagious disease of adulthood. \\n To make your job easier, here are some lessons from the book worth remembering and repeating: \\n \"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.\" \\n \"People have forgotten this truth,\" the fox said. \"But you mustn't forget it. You become responsible forever for what you've tamed.\" \\n \"One only understands the things that one tames,' said the fox. 'Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me.\" \\n \"\"Grown-ups love figures... When you tell them you've made a new friend they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you \"What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies? \" Instead they demand \"How old is he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make? \" Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.\" || So precious. || wow, whoops. forgot to ever say that i wrote a full(er) review of this and posted it on the ol' blog. my life is definitely together and not at all a mess. find it here: https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co.... along with a review of the little princess. \\n cute, right? i think it's pretty cute. \\n --------------------------- \\n this book was just as lovely the second time as it was the first. (and almost as great in english as in french.) \\n not sure if i can write extensively on this book. it's just so lovely and wonderful, and it really seems like one of those books that reveals another facet with every reading. \\n lovelovelove this one. || In a grimy underground locked public toilet The Little Prince wakes slowly, he's been out cold for hours. He's bleeding from a gash on his upper arm. He finds he is chained by leg irons to the wall. There is another person sharing his predicament. It's a bear, also chained to the opposite wall. In the center of the floor is the corpse of what appears to be donkey in a pool of blood. Near the corpse are a gun, a tape recorder and a saw. \\n \"Grownups are very strange,\" said the Little Prince to himself, sadly. || Book Review \\n 3 out of 5 stars to The Little Prince, a French children's story written in 1943 by Antoine de Saint-ExupA(c)ry. Have you ever read a book that was translated into your native language and thought, \"I've lost some beauty and meaning in this version?\" That's how I feel about this book. I read it in English as I cannot read, speak or write French. I know very little about the French, but with a few folks I've known, I can align this book with their personalities. Though it's deemed a children's book, in America, we're often a little less willing to give something like this to kids, so it's probably better for a new teenager to read. It has some pictures as well as story, so it's somewhere in the middle of YA versus children's book to me. \\n As for the story, consider it a moral lesson, an allegory, in how to live life. Comparing adults to children. Imagination to work. Freedom to structure. Why you choose to do something versus being told to do it. The characters are a little too direct or cold for me to connect with, but I do enjoy the conversation the book starts with young adults. It can teach you how to think on your own but also recognize there is a time and place for questioning why versus just doing the task. \\n I would like to learn French to see if I read something different from the book. But then again, without years of culture and history, it may not have the same impact as it does for someone who grew up in the environment. Anyone from France have a theory? I'd be curious... \\n About Me \\n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

Thanks for stopping by. || Beautiful dY'oe' || I was excited to get into this book because of its praise and was pleasantly surprised by the drinking allowed to occur within a children's book. The tale was worth reading and I see why someone would enjoy reading it to a child. At its best, The Little Prince encourages children to question authority and demand answers while portraying the adults of the world as confused. But at its worst, that prince was just an anecdotal part of a children's book with less substance than I expected. The part about the \"negro kings\" of Africa was also slightly outdated. || One of the books I remember from my childhood that I am still learning lessons from. || Yes, I know!! \\n I know this book is a piece of brilliance and it supposed to be everyone's favorite, but for me, it is just.... \\n I'm sorry, Little Prince. || Much more heartfelt than your usual constructed new age mysticism, but still falls to false separations and idealism. This is achieved by the inclusion of representational figures which do not stand in allegorically, but rather conceptually, and hence become not pure symbols but a set of tools for the construction of different philosophical scenarios. \\n The book also presents the requisite complexity needed for a holistic view of emotions and interaction, but falls to the very French fault of the author (or author surrogate) declaring themselves entirely correct about points which warrant more discussion and thought. \\n There is a fine line here between using such a representation to further thought by confrontation and trying to quiet it with thought terminating cliches. The reader may decide for themselves when Saint-Exupary crosses from one to the other. \\n It is unfortunate that a staple of children's literature is the stalwart declaration of comforting half-truths, but this is not uncommon even in adult books. Most New Age and Self-Help works are simply an extension of this to the (ostensibly) adult mind. \\n Unlike those myths of self-justification, the Little Prince occasionally presents some sense of wonder and mystery that overcomes the otherwise simple message. Its no Carroll, but there are times that it approaches that level of surrealism that opens a child's mind to something heretofore unimaginable. \\n Yet it is overall too self-satisfied with its message of naive wonder and reassuring but empty 'specialness'. || BookTube-A-Thon Challenege 2016 #1 Read a book with yellow on the cover. \\n BookTube-A-Thon Challenege 2016 #6 Read and watch a book-to-movie adaptation. || sry wl khh khtb rw khwndm bhsh 3 strh ddm , bh nZrm khtb zyd jlby nbwd,t ynkhh mrwz yh br dygh khtb rw b dqt byshtry khwndm \\n by nZyrbwd by nZyr \\n :qsmt hyy z khtb \\n khtrkhy r srG drm khh ykh aq srkh rwy'h twsh zndgy mykhnh. w hych wqt ykh gl r bw nkhrdh, hych wqt ykh strh r tmsh nkhrdh hych wqt khsy r dwst ndshth hych wqt jz jm` zdn `ddh khry nkhrdh. w hm mthl tw SbH t shb khrsh hmyn st khh bgwyd: <<mn ykh adm mhmm! ykh adm mhmm!>> yn r bgwyd w z Grwr bh khwdsh bd khnd. m khyl khrdh: w adm nyst, ykh qrch st! \\n ykh rwz drdi dl khnn bh mn gft: h<<Hqsh bwd bh Hrfhsh gwsh nmyddm. hych wqt nbyd bh Hrf glh gwsh dd. gl r fqT byd bwy'yd w tmsh khrd. gli mn tmmi khtrkhm r m`Tr mykhrd gyrm mn bld nbwdm chhjwry z an ldht bbrm. qDyhy chnglhy bbr khh an jwr damaGm khrdhbwd mybyst dlm r nrm khrdh bshd...>>h \\n ykh rwz dygr hm bh mn gft: h<<an rwzh ntwnstm chyzy bfhmm. mn byst rwy khrd w khri w dr brhsh qDwt mykhrdm nh rwy gftrsh... `Tragynm mykhrd. dlm r rwshn mykhrd. nmybyst zsh bgryzm. mybyst bh mhr w mHbty khh pshti an khlkhhy m`Swmnhsh pnhn bwd py mybrdm. glh purand z yn jwr tDdh. m khb dygr, mn khmtr z an bwdm khh rhi dwst dshtnsh r bdnm!>>h || Where are the people?\" resumed the little prince at last. \"It's a little lonely in the desert...\" \\n \"It is lonely when you're among people, too,\" said the snake. \\n I read somewhere that one word can mean more than than ten thousand. In that case... \\n The one word I would use to describe this book is: \\n Incredible. \\n If you haven't read it, I urge you to read it. It will make all your problems disappear for a moment, and make you feel, at least for a second, like a child. And if doesn't make you feel like a child or if you, perhaps, still are a child, then you needn't worry. I guarantee that it will make you feel... something. And it will be something special. || A declaration to dream \\n Aspects include: imagination is a positive trait; take the time to enjoy the sunset; tend friendships; and look within for importance. \\n Reading this story reminds me that being an adult \"adulting\" all of the time takes the charm out of life. Stop and smell the flowers || The Little prince is one of those famous books that seems that everyone has to read. In general, I like books with a great thesis that had been written to be understood as a child and as an adult (the two levels), but for me, The Little Prince abuses too much of metaphors and the direction of the moral meaning is too strong. I think its a great book but I didn't like as I thought I liked... \\n Spanish version: \\n El principito parece que es uno de esos libros tan famosos que todos tenemos que leer. En general, me gustan los libros con moraleja, que estan escritos para ser entendidos desde pequeno y desde adulto (dos niveles diferentes), pero el principito a veces se me hace un poco pesado por lo cargantemente metaforico que es. Creo que es un gran libro pero no me gusto tanto como esperaba... || Cuteness overloaded! \\n Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! \\n I will ensure that my kids read The Little Prince and books like this in my bedtime stories. \\n Before that, I want to read it again in French. || One of those books you are never too old and can never re-read enough. Some days, in fact, a book like this is precisely what you need. I was trying to figure out as I read it again what makes the book so \"universal\" so \"classic\" as in, you know, it will continue to be read and re-read forever. It struck me first that there was a quality of genius in the \"tone\" of the narration. Immediately you feel that you are in the presence of a kind, gentle soul. You are at home, take off your shoes, be your poor self, you're with someone who for some reason likes you. I think the \"tone\" of this book, or of any book, is probably the one thing about writing that cannot be learned. It's a touch, a grace given, a gift bestowed to the author. An author has it or an author doesn't. What Saint-Exupery is able to do and what all authors who have this need to do, is find a way to disappear so that the gift passes through the words unimpeded to the reader. The words, of course, need to be clear, simple, humble servants of the gift. That's the case with the words in this book, isn't it? Then I think this book is a classic because of it's spiritual message. When you see the word \"spiritual\" you think preachiness or religion, precepts and dogma, but the spiritual qualities of the book (of any great book) consist more in the way the book opens you, makes you receptive to memory and feeling and loss, reminds you that you are more than matter, more than getting and fretting and dying. There are all these \"things\" inside of you or outside of you that affect you or that you yearn for, things that you can't see with your eyes but which are there, plain as the sunset, as the Little Prince would say, if you would only let your heart see them. || ktbaar prrchi taar phrdd dite aasi naai / aajke prrio naai eittaa / ribhiuo dicchi naa / \\n aami ekttaa kthaa bhaabtechi ei bittaa niyye anekdin dhre, aajke ekjnke blte giyye mne hilo, ekhaane likhe raakhi / \\n aamaar dhaarnnaa ei bi baaccaaraa prrle taader bhaalo laagbe naa / aamaar syaampl spes chotto, ekhn prynt chyyjn baaccaake dichilaam, taader bhaalo laage naai, yaa aamaare ei bissyye aaro kaatthmollaa kreche / \\n aamaar bishbaas ei bittaa hcche seisb biyyer ekttaa, yegulaa prre brrraa ble, aah, aami baaccaa absthaayy ei bi chilo ki / \\n eittaa ekttaa brrder bi / aami brr hile taaraa dibo / ribhiuo tkhni dib / || mdt drzy msfr khwchwlw r ngh khrd. an wqt gft: -gr dlt mykhwhd mnw hly khn! \\n msfrkhwchwlw jwb dd: -dlm khh khyly mykhwhd, m wqti chndny ndrm. byd brwm dwstny pyd khnm w z khly chyzh sr dr arm. \\n rwbh gft: -adm fqT z chyzhyy khh hly khnd mytwnd sr dr ard. nsnh dygr bry sr dr awrdn z chyzh wqt ndrnd. hmh chyz r hmyn jwr HDr amdh z dkhnh mykhrnd. m chwn dkhny nyst khh dwst m`mlh khnd admh mndhnd bydwst... tw gr dwst mykhwhy khb mnw hly khn! \\n msfr khwchwlw prsyd: -rhsh chyst? \\n rwbh jwb dd: -byd khyly khyly HwSlh khny. wlsh ykh khrdh dwrtr z mn mygyry yn jwry myn `lfh mynshyny. mn zyr chshmy nght mykhnm w tw lmtkhm hychy nmygwyy, chwn tqSyr hmhy sw'itfhmh zyr sr zbn st. `wDsh mytwny hr rwz ykh khrdh nzdykhtr bnshyny. \\n trjmh zyby'yst ...   \n",



The misfortune that incessantly befell them was heartbreaking. \\n But the children are strong, so strong, and intelligent, and brave. They don't have anyone else in the world but each other. \\n I fell for them as deeply as I fell for A Little Princess' Sarah. How could we as readers not, after beholding such tragedy? \\n Because the orphans are so likeable, which led me to care for them and their future, I never wanted to stop reading. Being assured that Violet, Klaus and Sunny would find their happily ever after was my first preoccupation. \\n Many events conducted the lives of the Baudelaires and, although they were unmistakably unhappy and antagonistic ones, I found charming how much we learned about the characters from them. \\n However, the story and its protagonists are not the only elements that will enthral readers. I personally thought the writing style to be delightful... simple but elegant and effective. Without being overly descriptive, it produces vivid (grotesque) images in the reader's mind. \\n While I understand why some disliked the liberty the author took in interrupting the flow of events for a second or two to swiftly provide a definition for certain words (or expressions) more literal, I was never bothered by that and in fact welcomed the process. \\n I couldn't do anything else but read this in one sitting. They called to me, those dear Baudelaires. \\n Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin' || YES!!! My least favorite book in my favorite series! It just keeps getting better and better, folks. \\n So, for the three misguided people who havenaEUR(tm)t read this series - first off, get ON THAT. What are you doing? There is nothing so important in your life that you canaEUR(tm)t put it off in order to read this series. \\n https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co... || I'm reading through this series with my daughter Celyn (10 years old, very disabled, hence Dad does the reading). \\n Edit: Finished & reviewed all 13! \\n So, this is a clever, entertaining book set in a world like ours but populated with bizarre characters and with distinctly dark undercurrents. \\n Recurring themes throughout the series are: \\n i) Adults are mindbogglingly stupid. \\n ii) The narrator, Lemony Snicket, is a character we glimpse in tantalising snatches. \\n iii) Words that stretch a child's vocabulary are used regularly but defined in context (by the narrator) in an amusing way. \\n iv) The three siblings, Violet (14), Klaus (12), and Sunny (1) will use their singular talents (respectively inventor/bookworm/biter) to solve the problem. \\n v) That problem will be Count Olaaf \\n The book (like Roald Dahl's work) succeeds with a combination of wit, slapstick, and malice. \\n Short, very readable, will leave you wanting the next. \\n This one sets the scene, rapidly orphaning the children, establishing the goal (to survive long enough to take control of their huge inheritance), and their adversary (Count Olaaf and his theatre troop of sinister villains). \\n We have ten of the books because my elder children loved them when they were young. On book 5 I'm thinking we'll probably read them all. \\n EDIT: I have now posted reviews of all 13 books in the series - check them out! \\n You should join my 3-emails-a-year mailing list for updates about my books. #prizes http://eepurl.com/cimnK1 \\n .. || We have in Egypt this saying; \\n \"Who sees the Unfortunate Events of others feel solace about his own Unfortunates\" \\n \"lly yshwf mysfwrshnt yfynts lns thwn `lyh mysfwrshnth\" \\n So, 2016 wasn't my year -EST, 2011- and now I'm hitting \"rock bottom\",having \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" \\n So I said, why not give this title a try \\n \"accompanied by this mysterious black cat that sat with me the whole 2 hours read\" \\n It's really dark-fun Misfortune kids Orphans' story.. \\n And a Gothic villain. \\n And the author himself, Mr. Lemony Snicket; \\n who advises you repeatedly that this book is sad and misfortune and not with a happy endings..and please close it or return it if you can't handle all this misfortune.. \\n Even the TV show latest adaptation tells u to just \\n LOOK AWAY, well... that's true... you should stop reading this review now as well..look for something happier. \\n BUT as our beloved mother Country saying...which I said earlier, I didn't Look Away. \\n And that was.....sickly fun. \\n The Story \\n ------- \\n The Baudelaire 3 children lost their parents, their huge house and everything they own in a fire... But not their huge bank account. \\n Mr.Poe, the banker is the one responsible to see them to the 'proper' guardian. Proper here refer to something that never happened.. oh he delivered them to a guardian, but proper is not a suitable word to describe Count Olaf. \\n Who's has nothing to do with them but plotting to get his hand of their fortune. Which they even can't get their hand on it till the eldest -Violet,14- come of age. \\n To try to get their fortune. He puts them in a Series of Unfortunate Events. \\n And by the second half of the Book One.. his first grand plan is to wed Violet by deceive .. \\n How , how can they know the deceive, how can they escape his plan without endanger their lives??? that's the book one for you. \\n Oh and no matter what do you think.. the author stick to his word. \\n No Happy Endings here.. \\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\n The Writing Style \\n ------------- \\n It's really like children book, the style, the easy sentences and even when the author use a big or fancy word he always give the meaning of it even if it's easy in a very funny way. Also he does that in expressions and literature techniques as well. \\n It's sarcastic and if it's really a children's book..it's the Darkest one ever written. \\n If you read of Mr. Lemony Snicket's real life you'll feel he's been 'forced' somehow to write a children books. It's 1999, the phenomenon of Harry Potter was on the catching fire stage.., that's why the result comes like it's a Satire of children books.. Satire here means a dark fun sarcastic imitation of normal life children books. \\n The creating of the Lemony Snicket constant commentaries through the book as a detective who investigate the Baudelaire orphans' Series and tell this as a story for ether very young readers, or slow ones, that worked as a very funny 'comic relief' amidst all the Misfortune Unfortunate Events Series. \\n 'Comic Relief' here means small funny moments that gets between more tensed or serious ones. \\n Well.. \\n That's it for a small book reviews. I over talked it I guess.. but I really loved this absurd dark fun of... \\n Unfortunate Events. \\n Mohammed Arabey \\n 16 January 2017 \\n To 17 January 2017 || So the premise of this book (as the narrator keeps helpfully reminding us) is that this group of three children will continue to have difficult problems to overcome, and every time they succeed in dealing with one problem, another will crop up. In the writing business, this is what's known as 'a plot'. \\n But then he takes it one step further: in addition to all the difficulties along the way, he assures us that the characters will never break this pattern, and there will be no 'happy ending'. I think this is a good idea, especially in a children's book, because we, as a culture, don't have enough role models for failure. \\n We have lots of role models for how to behave when we win, but this isn't really very useful--it's not when we win that we most need guidance and aid. We need more examples of how to maintain, how to persevere, in the face of failure. \\n At this point, our only role models for what to do when we fail are villains, who tend to get angry, yell, whine, take it out on subordinates, and then develop vengeful plans to make everyone feel as bad as they do. The unfortunate result is that people often begin to act like villains when things don't go well, an effect which can be observed most easily by holding a job where you have a boss. \\n So I'm all for 'no easy wrap ups' at the end of the story, but unfortunately, Snicket is unable to develop a conclusion without this easy route. It takes a very skilled writer to eschew convention and still write something interesting, and his reasons for avoiding standard practices should not be merely to differentiate himself, but to achieve some alternative goal for his story. \\n There are authors who have achieved this, even in children's fiction--Lewis Carroll and Roald Dahl being the preeminent examples. When Snicket laid out the premise of his books, I began to look for something along the lines of those two authors, who, despite creating stories of children suffering constantly and unfairly, managed to write entertaining, enjoyable stories. \\n But then those stories were wild and vivid, even when they were dark. Dahl's ability to create grotesque, powerful characters made for dynamic, engrossing stories, while Carroll's quick, fertile mind kept us always guessing, and often laughing, despite Alice's constant frustrations. \\n Though Snicket is trying for a witty style, he rarely gets there. After the second chapter, all his jokes have already been established, the rest are only minor variations on the same themes. There are no surprising insights to back up his humor, nothing unexpected, just a continuance of the same tone: dry, but not acerbic. \\n The characters, likewise, show little variance. The vocabulary and speech patterns are all very similar, whether adults, children, villains, or heroes. We are often told of differences in character by the narrator, but these never actually make it into the characters' mouths. \\n Since the characters are fairly cliche and undifferentiated, Snicket cannot hang the plot on them, like Dahl would. They cannot provide the vibrant impetus for the plot, so Snicket's plot instead becomes a series of convenient (or conveniently inconvenient) events. \\n The writing itself is not bad, it's mostly just a case of Snicket not being clever or dark enough to buoy his premise. In the end, not much stands out, not the characters, nor the humor. \\n I applaud his attempt to address difficult and painful issues in his books, and without resorting to basic melodrama, but tragedy is measured by the subject's capacity for pain, so characters must be vivid and deep in order for events to feel truly unfortunate; otherwise, it just becomes the same array of problems common to every plot. || Glad to say these lived up the the expectations of my 10-year old self. Off to check out the show! || To Beatrice-darling, dearest, dead. \\n If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book. In this book, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. \\n I think it is important how a book starts, because that sets the tone for the rest of the book. I myself have been guilty of prematurely-\"prematurely\" here means \"before the time is appropriate\"- judging the quality of a book based on its beginning. In this case, however, while the book itself is called The Bad Beginning, there is nothing bad about the beginning of the book itself. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events chronicles the tales of the three Baudelaire siblings. Siblings who are smart, inventive, and just a wee bit precocious. \\n Violet Baudelaire, the eldest, liked to skip rocks. ... Anyone who knew Violet well could tell she was thinking hard, because her long hair was tied up in a ribbon to keep it out of her eyes. Violet had a real knack for inventing and building strange devices, so her brain was often filled with images of pulleys, levers, and gears, and she never wanted to be distracted by something as trivial as her hair. \\n Klaus Baudelaire, the middle child, and the only boy, liked to examine creatures in tidepools. ... He knew how to tell an alligator from a crocodile. He knew who killed Julius Caesar. And he knew much about the tiny, slimy animals found at Briny Beach, which he was examining now. \\n Sunny Baudelaire, the youngest, liked to bite things. \\n What? She is only an infant, after all... \\n Despite the warning at the beginning of the book, one might come to this story with some hope in their hearts. Such people are fools. There is no hope in this story. However, seeing as how this is a children's book, and banking on man's innate nature to seek closure, I would like to go out on a limb and say that eponymous series of unfortunate events, however, do end well for the Baudelaire orphans. Not this book, though, not at all. The Bad Beginning has an equally crappy conclusion. Forgive my alliteration game, it's not as strong as Mr. Snicket's. But then again, he couldn't really alliterate The End either, could he? \\n They didn't understand it, but like so many unfortunate events in life, just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't so. \\n I also strongly believe that a villain makes or breaks a story, and Count Olaf makes this one. He steals the show. Maybe that's just me, because I imagined Neil Patrick Harris's version of it speaking all the lines... Actually, no. It isn't just me. Olaf is so much of an over-the-top villain, it is delightful to read about his schemes, hair-brained and far-fetched as they may be. \\n I don't remember the last time I read a \"children's book\", and let me tell you, the experience is more fun as an adult. Alliterations like \\n Doldrum Drive \\n , \\n Fickle Fountain \\n , and \\n Mulctuary Money Management \\n got my panties in a twist. Or how about this super awesome way of learning new words?! (Side note, if I had a penny for every time the word mean was repeated in any of its forms, I'd be very rich.) Anyway, I digress. Handler uses his book as a teaching tool of sorts, where he uses uncommon words, and then explains their meaning. Such explanation may be circumstantial or literal. \\n ...the sauce simmered, a culinary term which means \"cooked over low heat.\" \\n ...the word \"incentive\" here means \"an offered reward to persuade you to do something you don't want to do\"... \\n \"'Posthaste,'\" he said, \"means--\" \"--means you'll do nothing to help us\"... \\n Klaus sighed, and relinquished--a word which here means \"gave to Count Olaf even though he didn't want to\"--the book on nuptial law. \\n The biggest grammar lesson, that Lemony Snicket focuses on, however, is a lesson that the world very much needs today. \\n It is very useful, when one is young, to learn the difference between \"literally\" and \"figuratively.\" If something happens literally, it actually happens; if something happens figuratively, it feels like it's happening. If you are literally jumping for joy, for instance, it means you are leaping in the air because you are very happy. If you are figuratively jumping for joy, it means you are so happy that you could jump for joy, but are saving your energy for other matters. \\n So yeah, one cannot \"literally have a ball of fire in their throat\" or \"literally jump through hoops to get a job done\" (unless they're circus artistes trained to do such a thing, of course). \\n And finally, Lemony Snicket teaches you the value of family and togetherness, and of the simple pleasures in life. It could be simple sentences like this \\n The smell of cooking food is often a calming one... \\n , or slightly more complex emotions like \\n Sometimes, just saying that you hate something, and having someone agree with you, can make you feel better about a terrible situation. \\n Unless you have been very, very lucky, you have undoubtedly experienced events in your life that have made you cry. So unless you have been very, very lucky, you know that a good, long session of weeping can often make you feel better, even if your circumstances have not changed one bit. \\n Though I'm more often than not unable to take my own advice, I have always emphasised on the benefits of a good, solid cry. It gives you energy to trudge along and complete whatever horrible task it was, or confront whoever it was that made you cry. \\n Oh, it is pertinent here to mention-\"pertinent\", here means important-that this book is a rather good \"How-to\" guide on baby-talk. \\n \"Yeeka!\" Sunny shrieked, which appeared to mean \"How interesting!\" \\n \"Wipi!\" Sunny shrieked, which meant \"I'd much prefer gardening to sitting around watching my siblings struggle through law books.\" \\n So yeah, adults can learn much from this book also. I recommend this one, I do. || This is the first time I have reread this since the first time I read the series. I listened to the audiobook for this and loved it! || People have always told me that this was a dark series, but I didn't expect it to be this dark! This is a children's book series?! :') It was great, I really enjoyed it!! I can't wait to carry on with this series, which to be honest, I wasn't expecting to feel! It was such an interesting, short and quick read and thankfully didn't traumatise me or scar me for life like the movie did at eight years old... || Read this for booktubeathon! \\n I wasn't expecting this book to be as creepy as it was, if I read this when I was younger I would have been terrified! || What can I say? These books are amazing. Lemony Snicket does not dumb things down for children, and for that I am eternally grateful. He uses great words in this book, such as: insipid, aberrant, declaim, predicament, Molotov cocktails, incur, adroit, relinquish, nuptial, posthaste, in loco parentis, and mulctuary. Most of these words are explained in a great, kid-friendly way. A few are not, and that's when the child reaches for his/her dictionary. This is a great way of teaching children new words. \\n Some people, especially older people, have expressed to me their strong dislike of books that are popular today - such as Harry Potter, Divergent, Hunger Games, and A Series of Unfortunate Events. They have told me that they are concerned. Aren't these books too dark for children? Won't reading about death and fighting and hard choices make them scared and confused? \\n I think a lot of people forget that these very things are what hold a child's interest. Worrying about the characters, wondering what will happen to them, feeling a sense of dread when the protagonists land in some sticky situations...all of this leads to the children reading another page and another...to find out what happens. Dumbed-down books with no difficult words and no \"scary\" situations or difficult choices make for dull reading. People forget that the original versions of fairy tales were very dark and scary, and that children love complicated puzzles and complex situations. \\n In addition, this book makes it extremely clear from the onset that it is going to be dark and full of difficulties and distress. It is, after all, called A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. Actually, a good bit of humor comes from Snicket's warnings about how dire the circumstances are in the book and his frequent suggestions that you \"stop reading immediately.\" This, of course, has the opposite effect, and only makes the reader more interested. \\n Actually, in spite of their dark and dismal content, these books are hilarious! Snicket's descriptions are charming and he has a way of writing to his audience that is enchanting and magical. I adore this idea of a \"gothic novel\" for young readers. Adults will love it too, and that makes it even better. \\n When these books came out, I was no longer a child, but I was lucky enough to have a loved one read them out loud to me. I would drive this person to places quite frequently, as that person had no car, and as I drove I was read to out loud in a superb array of voices. I still remember how each of them sounded and they sound the same way in my head even now! Nowadays, I am the one reading this books out loud to children, and I still use those same great voices that my loved one used when reading these books to me! Children LOVE the voices and LOVE the stories. Currently, I know many children who do not read much and tell me that they are \"not into reading\", but have made an exception for this series. Especially since they see the series as \"cool\" and \"not dorky\". Shrug. \\n I have never seen the movie with Jim Carrey and have no desire to. \\n Another thing that I admire about these books is the strong, loving relationship between the Baudelaire orphans. Relying on and trusting each other, they always have each other's backs. They are smart, brave, inventive, and kind. I have a special place in my heart for books with strong sibling relationships, since I truly believe your siblings can be your best friends in life. Even in the most depressing situations, the Baudelaires know that they have each other, and that makes them strong. Family can be a surprisingly stunning asset to have, even when one has no money, no friends, and even sometimes, no real home. || 4 STARS \\n Now that was fun... and dark and mess up. I loved it. Am I evil for liking stories where children get fucked over? I am lol I just love dark middle grade too much. #sorrynotsorry \\n I remember picking up this book in middle school, reading the first few pages and then putting it down. Ever since, I passed these books time after time in stores and libraries and never thought to pick the first book up again... until now. \\n Everyone knows what this book is about so I don't feel the need to explain it but I loved the darkness and humor this book was filled with. Even thought a lot of people hate the movie, I LOVE it and had fun imagining the movie's actors as the characters in his book and it made it all the better for me. I think Jim Carrey did an amazing job at Count Olaf. \\n A lot of people said he didn't do him justice, but to be honest, the book's version of Olaf is pretty tame compared to the movie version. Maybe in the next books he gets worse, but I enjoyed the humor Jim brought to the role and that's one of the reasons I love the movie so much. \\n I can't wait to read The Reptile Room and The Wide Window since they were also adapted in the movie as well and those were my favorite parts of it. \\n I also loved how quick this went by, I read it in a day, which for some is a piece of cake, but for me is a rewarding experience lol \\n Again, I can't wait to dive more into this series and see what other things the orphans get into and what Count Olaf and his #squad got in store. \\n Oh yes, and I want badly to smack myself for not getting into this series sooner. It's going to be a ride, reading all 13 but I will do it in small doses so that I don't exhaust myself. But I am planning on reading the next two in the series very soon. \\n If you haven't read this and you enjoy dark middle grade, READ IT. \\n I'll be talking more about it in my March Wrap Up. \\n -Richard \\n P.S. I want to thank the comments of my most recent video for getting me to get my ass to the library and grab a copy of this book. THANK YOUUUU!! || The show is coming to Netflix and it looks awesome! \\n Trailer \\n The highest review currently showing on my feed is a one star review by an adult who has no children. He read books meant for middle schoolers and found them so bad he hoped to have the opportunity to physically torture the author. Oookkkay.... \\n Well I'm currently reading this series with my daughter and we are delighted with it. \\n There is a strong mystery element that improves as the books go along. My daughter loves this aspect and is constantly guessing about what will happen next. \\n The style is wonderfully unique with a very strong and intrusive narrative voice. As the series continues this begins to make more sense as Snicket becomes a character in the books. \\n The book is also quite humorous. Lj has never been exposed to the sort of duel meaning that is ocassionally employed by Snicket and found it engaging. The definitions of difficult words is really interesting. It would not have worked in a different series but the narrative style allows it and we found it a fun gimmick. It has actually improved her vocab although sometimes the definitions are not quite right and are actually amusing. \\n This is the first series LJ has read with such defined story structure and it appears to have helped with her own story writing. \\n I loved the ingenuity the novels inspire. I also loved that Violet was the inventor. My daughter loves science experiments, building things and coding so it was great to see a female MC that had these traits. We stopped reading How to Train your Dragon before picking this book up because we were 50 pages in and no female had spoken in the novel yet (not one!). So in that regard these books have been wonderful. \\n I would recommend these books to everyone with children. They are great for reading aloud as the writing is clean and sentences are rarely awkward (I still get nightmares about reading all three series in the Deltora quest by Rhodda). \\n They also move along at a brisk enough pace that reading aloud doesn't become tedious (unlike The Hobbit and The Secret Garden which she ended up reading alone). The style won't be for everyone but it will only take children a couple of chapters to decide whether the book is for them. || Despues de todo el hype por la serie de Netflix, las peliculas, el haber conocido en persona al autor (una persona peculiar como las haya) y los \"!Oh, por Dios! ?Eres booktuber y no te has leido los libros de Lemony Snicket?\"... !por fin he empezado esta serie! Y no me emociono mucho. \\n Este primer libro, Un Mal Principio, el primero de once (creo), nos introduce en la historia de como los hermanos Baudelaire se quedan huerfanos y terminan pasando por la custodia de personajes tan horrorosos y negligentes como Mr. Poe y el Conde Olaf. Si bien los chicos son multimillonarios, no pueden hacer uso de su herencia hasta que la hermana mayor, Violet, sea mayor de edad... y aqui empezaran los problemas, pues el Conde Olaf esta decidido a quedarse con toda la fortuna de los hermanos. \\n Si bien el libro es entretenido y me gusta la forma en que esta narrado, no me motivaba a seguir leyendo porque adivine la treta que estaba planeando el Conde Olaf desde la mitad del libro. Y si, se que es un libro infantil, pero hay algunos que han logrado sorprenderme. Lo que si es seguro es que no abandonare la saga (casi nunca lo hago), pues todos me dicen que los libros van mejorando, asi que... !a por ella! || My partner loves these books and has been urging me to read them for years now. Unlike me, the science nerd, she is a word nerd, and I guess I can see her attraction to the book. But I think it was lost on me. \\n If you have no idea of what's going on, and I presume that I am one of the last people on the planet other than some isolated tribes in Papua New Guinea to know the story, three children are suddenly orphaned and sent to live with a distant relative who is a Count. He is a classic evil villain who is only after the children inherited fortune that they cannot touch until adulthood. But the Count has other plans. \\n In my opinion this is as simple as the book gets. Sure there is a little wit and cleverness and some admiring attempt to teach the audience new vocabulary, but I wasn't entertained, I only slightly felt any emotion for the children and the author's constant urgings to put the book down if you don't like it almost had me convinced. \\n Maybe you have to be in the series for the long game, to build up an emotional attachment to the children. Maybe you need to be an 8 year old. Maybe you just need to stop thinking about an older relative attempting to marry a fourteen year old girl and then insisting they go back to his place on the marriage night. Yeah, bad creepy book. Not good creepy book. Maybe I am just overthinking a simple kids book. \\n Will I read more? I don't know. || I was right to retain such a strong opinion of Snicket. These books were very important to my childhood and it's still brilliant. His style is so unique, clever and likeable. His stories and characters are gripping and original. This book is a great start to one of the best children's series ever. \\n Re-reading this book as an adult, and the whole series, is so very rewarding, because you pick up on lots of references you didn't get as a kid, and can appreciate its messages so much after you've been through growing up and everything life throws at you. || My heart sank while reading this. || *reread: 1-(29-30)-17* \\n Sadly this wasn't as good as I remember it. There was intrigue, but it was diluted but the writing and the characters seemed different, but sometimes I felt annoyed by their monotone-ness? || Esta por salir la serie en Netflix y ya saben, pecado no leer los libros antes. || 3.75/5 \\n This was so much fun! \\n I guess I'm one of those rare people who never got to read these books when they were a kid, so I have no nostalgic memories attached to this series whatsoever. That being said, I couldn't be more sorry about it. \\n Gaaah! If I could only turn back time and give this to 8 year old me! \\n While this first book is only an introduction to the story and the characters, I'm already so fond of it. The atmoshpere is eerie and weird and creepy at times and the characters are so cool and quirky! Count Olaf is one rather scary and odd specimen, but he's such a good villain. The writing is witty and so easy to get through and I can't praise it enough. \\n And now onto the next books and the Netflix series (which is the reason why I decided to dive into these books in the first place).   \n",
